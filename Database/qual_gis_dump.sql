1	When green spaces compete with other forms of land use, especially in dense urban settings, their creation and maintenance need to be extensively justified. Very often the utilitarian arguments, such as reference to recreational uses or air quality improvement, are seen as the most convincing to illustrate the importance of green spaces for cities. However, people derive many other benefits from urban green spaces, many of which elude such a simplified practical focus. In this paper, we present an analysis of the values and important attributes that urban residents assign to green spaces. The data were collected in three cities in Poland: Krakow, Lodz and Poznan, using a public participation GIS approach an online geo-questionnair. Overall, 1640 people took part in the survey. The results exhibit a wide spectrum of values associated with urban green spaces, emphasizing the importance of the multiple cultural and anthropogenic aspects associated with urban green spaces. The study illustrates differences in the valuation of formal and informal green spaces. The latter include all the areas that are not formally demarcated or have an uncertain land tenure status. Places valued for their greenness, pleasant views, uniqueness, wild character and role as natural habitats are predominantly marked outside of formal green spaces. We highlight the challenges in the classification of urban green spaces and the need to identify and address informal green spaces in urban green space governance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

2	Obtaining useful geographic information from the flood of user-generated geographic content (UGGC) data is of significant interest, but comes with challenges in an age of crowdsourcing. To address this issue, we adopt Maslow's model of human needs to frame UGGC. Synthesizing across literature about volunteered geographic information and participatory GIS, we present a conceptual framework for characterizing collection of UGGC. The framework is composed of multiple dimensions and levels that include perspectives about motivations, participatory methods, and participants. We also articulate four levels of participants (stakeholders, core-engaged participants, semi-core-engaged participants, and engaged citizens) together with four work principles (communication, cooperation, coordination, and collaboration). Finally, a case study describes an example we use to evaluate the conceptual framework for its suitability in design of a UGGC system. We conclude by reflecting on how and why this framework offers a valuable perspective for deriving useful geographic information and offer future research directions.	10.1080/15230406.2016.1163644	WOS:000390389400002	2017	A framework for user-generated geographic content acquisition in an age of crowdsourcing
3	It is essential to ensure equal accessibility to services, such as sport and recreation facilities or green and water environments. Differences in accessibility can potentially cause negative health and social welfare implications. Accessibility and service area analyses from the perspective of access equality are typically rather simple. They are often based on arbitrary travel-distance thresholds and made only with a single mode of transport in mind. Thus, they exclude the multidimensional nature of accessibility where individuals' travel behavior and perceived accessibility also play an important role. In this paper, a PPGIS method was used to empirically investigate distances and durations that respondents travel with different modes of transport to access popular water environments. Service area analyses were built on person-based and objectively measured threshold values that not only take into account the spatio-temporal elements of transport networks and a land use component but also recognize the requirements and preferences of individuals and their capacity to access and participate. The results showed that the most common mode of transport to access waters is walking. Generally, the residents travel by foot for 1.7 km to access water environments. Cars were found as the second most common mode of transport used, and most of the popular water environments are accessible by car from every corner of the study area in a given travel threshold time. The results demonstrate the importance of deriving local parameters and the potential of the PPGIS approach for accessibility and service area delineation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

4	Parks and protected areas provide a wide range of benefits, but methods to evaluate their importance to society are often ad hoc and limited. In this study, the quality of crowdsourced information from Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) sources (Flickr, OpenStreetMap (OSM), and Wikipedia) was compared with visitor counts that are presumed to reflect social importance. Using the state of Victoria, Australia as a case study, secondary crowdsourced VGI data, primary crowdsourced (PPGIS data) and visitor statistics were examined for their correspondence and differences, and to identify spatial patterns in park popularity. Data completeness the percent of protected areas with data varied between sources, being highest for OSM (90%), followed by Flickr (41%), PPGIS (24%), visitation counts (5%), and Wikipedia articles (4%). Statistically significant correlations were found between all five measures of popularity for protected areas. Using stepwise multiple linear regression, the explained variability in visitor numbers was greater than 70%, with PPGIS, Flickr and OSM having the largest standardized coefficients. The social importance of protected areas varied as a function of accessibility and the types of values (direct or indirect use) expressed for the areas. Crowdsourced data may provide an alternative to visitor counts for assessing protected area social importance and spatial variability of visitation.

54	Transcribing what is held in one's mind to a tangible map is experiencing a multidisciplinary renewal. Sketch mapping is being utilized to identify a range of community concerns, as well as for more generally revealing otherwise invisible landscapes. Whether the aim is to understand preference, perception, knowledge, or behavior, the result is some form of map. The genesis of this concept is usually attributed to seminal work in the 1960s and 1970s geography, planning, and environmental psychology. However, its resurgence in the past decade has been driven by a confluence of recent methodological and epistemological developments across numerous disciplines surrounding the role of local knowledge in ecological frameworks and how this can be mapped and analyzed with and without geospatial technologies. With growing adoption of sketch mapping well beyond its initial disciplinary niches, it is appropriate to review its evolution in order to inform ongoing and future research.	10.1111/j.1931-0846.2016.12193.x	WOS:000381291200005	2016	Transcribing from the Mind To the Map
5	Participatory mapping in social research is characterized by methodological pluralism, with two common methods being qualitative mapping using stakeholder interviews and quantitative methods that engage larger public samples through digital, internet mapping. To date, there has been no systematic evaluation of the extent to which mixed methods in participatory mapping yield valid results when applied to the same research setting and research questions. A mixed methods research design (combined exploratory sequential and convergent parallel) was implemented in a large research project to identify marine and coastal values in the Kimberley region of Australia. Qualitative interviews (n = 167) were completed with stakeholders to identify place-based values using polygon mapping methods and internet-based public participation GIS-(PPGIS) methods (n = 578). We defined and operationalized the concepts of concurrent, commensurate, and convergent validity to assess mixed methods research outcomes. We found that qualitative and quantitative methods resulted in moderate to high concurrent validity when assessing the importance of place values in the study area. Convergent validity (spatial) was highly variable by place value, with stronger convergent validity found with mapped aesthetic, recreational fishing, tourism, biodiversity, and Aboriginal culture values, and weakest with existence, therapeutic, and commercial fishing values. Convergent validity was influenced by weak commensurate validity through the use of different geometric features (polygons versus points) for mapping values across a large study area. The utility of mixed methods for planning decision support in a convergent parallel design depends on demonstrating convergence in construct meaning, spatial location, and consistency in values in the sampling populations.

6	Features of the physical environment have an impact on the human behaviour. Thus, planners and policymakers around the world should aim at providing environments that are perceived as being of good quality, inwhich the residents enjoy spending time and moving around in. It iswidely acknowledged that urban environmental quality associateswith well-being, but there is currently very little research examining which features of urban environments people of different ages perceive as appealing in their living environments. Individuals experience different age-related developmental environments throughout their life course. Thus, the usage and perceptions of different spaces can also differ between various age groups. Public Participation GIS datasets collected in 2009 and 2011 in Helsinki Metropolitan Area were used to study places perceived as being positive by adults (n= 3119) and children (n= 672). Participants marked points on a map that were overlaid with GIS data to study whether the physical environment of positive places of different age groups differed. The results demonstrated that the physical environment differs significantly in the positive places of different age groups. The places of adult age groupswere characterized by green, blue and commercial spaces, whereas sports, residential and commercial spaces characterize children's and adolescents' places. Older adults' places were found to be closest to home, while adolescents' places were the most distant. Providing appealing environments for all age groups in one setting remains problematic but should nevertheless be strived for, especially in the urban context where a constant competition over different usages of space occurs.

7	Global interest in participatory mapping described as public participation GIS (PPGIS), participatory GIS (PGIS), and volunteered geographic information (VGI) continues to grow, but systematic study of spatial data quality and sampling effects is limited. This article provides a review and meta-analysis of Internet-based PPGIS studies conducted during the period 2006-2015 (n=26) to answer the following research questions: (1) How does mapping effort, as a proxy measure for spatial data quality, differ by sampling group? (2) Does the purpose and context of PPGIS influence mapping results? (3) What is the potential for mapping bias through sampling design? (4) Given the results, what should be the focus of future PPGIS research? Mapping effort was highest in sampling groups whose livelihoods were closely related to the purpose of the study, there was greater mapping effort in household sampling groups compared to volunteer groups, and participant domicile had strong effects on mapped results through spatial discounting. The use of online Internet panels provides higher response rates but lower spatial data quality. Future research should focus on increasing sampling response rates, assessing social trade-offs using alternative spatial weighting schemes, and examining the capacity of the public to select land use alternatives as a complement to traditional expert-driven planning systems.	10.1111/tgis.12207	WOS:000394689700002	2017	A Review of Sampling Effects and Response Bias in Internet Participatory Mapping (PPGIS/PGIS/VGI)
8	This article applies Geographic Information Technologies (GIT) to the field of Cultural Heritage (CH), aiming to analyse patrimonial valuation through Digital Representations (DR). It seeks to briefly introduce the importance of DR through the concepts of the individual's spatial cognition (mental) and physical (external) perceptions. It approaches the main topics of 3D data acquisition, modelling and visualisation, as well as cultural heritage applications, and presents 3D and Augmented Reality (AR) trials, together with their main results and discussion. The methodology consists of exploratory data acquisition using terrestrial and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), 3D modelling procedures, and the integration between 3D-Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and AR environments (mobile platforms) applied to patrimonial systems and elements in urban areas. The results consist of several Trials and products of 3D acquisition and modelling processes to be visualised in an AR environment. These allow for adjusting the core solutions for further mobile application development. Taking the ancient Lisbon (Aqueduct) water supply system (classified as a national monument) as a case study, the fact that most of it is imperceptible, owing to the large extent of the undergrown galleries, enables the onsite visualisation of the relation between the system and the city elements within a mixed reality environment. The methods used aimed to strengthen the idea of the potential application of this technology for heritage valuation, associating the use of geographic information to fields commonly related to a strong visual perception of space, providing essential data not only for occasional users (public), but also for specialised technicians, opinion/decision makers, promoters and other stakeholders.	10.5821/ace.11.33.4686	WOS:000396618600006	2017	Cultural Heritage 3d Modelling and Visualisation within an Augmented Reality Environment, Based on Geographic Information Technologies and Mobile Platforms
263	In my second report discussing the state of historical geography, I review some of the ways historical geographers have made use of digital technologies and digital media. I also highlight how digital data, research, and presentation are affecting related humanities disciplines and inspiring their practitioners to engage more fully with geographic concepts of space, place, and cartography. I argue that information technologies and digital media can deepen the place of historical geography in the academy and in the public's eye.	10.1177/0309132512462807	WOS:000321492600006	2013	Historical geography II
9	Recent shifts in web map technology away from proprietary software and toward development on the Open Web Platform have increased the number and complexity of technical skills needed to do cartography on the Web. Web-based cartography curricula likewise must be adapted to prepare geography, cartography, and GIS students with the skills needed to make use of open source technology. This paper describes the design and evaluation of anovel curriculum for the laboratory component of a web mapping course offered by a university geography department. We drew from constructivist educational theory to create a scaffolded and spiralled lab curriculum that builds on prior understanding and progressively increases student independence and confidence. We evaluated the success of the new curriculum through an instructor log, student feedback on assignments, and an exit survey. The evaluation revealed significant growth in student abilities and confidence in the use of Open Web Platform-based mapping tools as a result of the curriculum scaffolding. This research provides a methodology for designing and evaluating curriculum around highly technical skills that are increasingly in demand in research, education, and industry careers.	10.1080/03098265.2016.1241987	WOS:000392982100001	2017	Design and evaluation of an Open Web Platform cartography lab curriculum
10	Green space at different distances is important for the wellbeing of urban dwellers. However, since these different types of green space are, for the most part, investigated in separate studies, it is difficult to disentangle how the use and appreciation of nearby and more distant nature by urban dwellers is related. To address this issue, we conduct an analysis in which we directly compare the appreciation and use of green spaces at four different spatial levels: neighbourhood, region, national, and world level, for urban residents in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. For this we use a quantitative, internet-based, participatory GIS method. The relationship between the use of local and more distant green spaces by urban dwellers has generally been addressed in terms of compensation. Our results indicate that this relationship can also be viewed in a complementary way. Urban residents appear to have a 'portfolio of natural places'. This portfolio consists of favourite places nearby that are rated lower but visited quite often, and natural places that they find highly attractive but are located farther away and visited less often. Local favourite places offer basic access to green and nature while other more distant natural places offer a larger variety of qualities and recreational possibilities. Results also indicate that, in order to meet the needs of urban residents, more than the immediate urban context needs to be considered in urban planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

11	Early advocates of Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) envisioned a future in which members of the public (broadly) and members of marginalized communities (specifically) would utilize geographic information and spatial technologies to affect positive change within their communities. Yet in spite of the emergence and success of PPGIS, open source geospatial tools, and the geoweb, access barriers recognized by proponents of PPGIS in the mid-1990s persist. As a result, PPGIS facilitators continue to be instrumental in addressing access barriers to geospatial technologies among resource poor organizations and marginalized groups. 'Community geography', is a growing area of academic geography that leverages university community partnerships to facilitate access to spatial technology, data, and analysis. Experiences from community geography programmes at three universities (Chicago State University, Syracuse University, and Columbus State University) demonstrate the benefits and challenges of a facilitated model of PPGIS.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1244322	WOS:000396700100002	2017	Community Geography
12	Similarity between the objects has close association with the geometrical structure and details of the objects. Therefore, in this study, a framework was presented based on the geometric criteria, the fuzzy Membership Functions (MF) and human spatial cognition. To increase the efficiency of MF and for the problem to get closer to reality, 1 K, 2 K, 5 K, 10 K, 25 K, 50 K, and 100 K data were used in this framework. The results showed that the degree of spatial similarity is specific to the objects themselves and their geometric structure. No linear or non-linear relationship could be found between scale changes and degree of spatial similarity of the objects, because the geometry of any object independently affects its degree of similarity to other objects in different scales and sources.	10.1080/10106049.2016.1155659	WOS:000396895500001	2017	An assessment of spatial similarity degree between polylines on multi-scale, multi-source maps
13	Despite myriad studies having been carried out on the diffusion of geographical information systems (GIS) technology, only a limited number have been done within the context of developing countries. This paper addresses the research question, how did the diffusion of GIS technology occur in Uganda? Mixed methods were used for data collection, and analysis was performed using a theoretical framework called the diffusion of innovations (DOI). The results of the study showed that the adoption of GIS by institutions in Uganda occurred in a classic diffusion pattern consistent with diffusion theory. Adoption of GIS was promoted by its relative advantage over, and compatibility with, existing technologies. It was characterized by both heterophilous and homophilous communication channels, and influenced by change agents and champions. Its rate of adoption followed an S-shaped diffusion curve, and was hampered by bureaucracy, and patronage-based societal norms. This study makes a contribution to literature on GIS diffusion in developing countries.	10.1080/13658816.2016.1242131	WOS:000394663700004	2017	GIS diffusion in Uganda
14	This paper describes the findings of a novel participatory geographic information systems (PGISs) methodology designed to support vulnerability and disaster risk management (DRM) efforts in small Caribbean communities. The methodology combines community vulnerability mapping with geo-referenced household data through a step-by-step approach to record information on household vulnerability and community hazards. We used partial PGIS to demonstrate the benefits of implementing a participatory mapping technique with an external facilitator who undertook the technical geographic information system aspects of the mapping process. Results show that as a tool for knowledge co-production and stakeholder engagement, PGIS can be useful to record local spatial knowledge on vulnerability and hazards whilst supporting the development of risk and vulnerability reduction measures. By helping community members understand and manage vulnerability, this approach has the potential to become an important mechanism to support vulnerability reduction and DRM strategies in small Caribbean communities. Following the approach described in this paper, similar activities can be easily replicated in other parts of the world.	10.1080/17565529.2015.1067593	WOS:000393873100001	2017	Using partial participatory GIS in vulnerability and disaster risk reduction in Grenada
15	Participatory approaches elicit information from multiple stakeholders while planning and implementing resource management systems. Such elicited information is often associated with significant variability. Public participation geographical information science (GIS) (PP-GIS) solutions can reduce this variability by helping stakeholders to measure the factors involved and provide the elicited information. We propose a Quality Function Deployment'-based participatory framework for developing such PP-GIS solutions. It is demonstrated using a case study to enhance an existing PP-GIS into a solution for rainwater harvesting systems in Indian villages. The novelty of the proposed framework is that it identifies metrics and carries out comparative analysis of three existing solutions: participatory rural appraisal, participatory mapping and PP-GIS. In the case study, PP-GIS scored less than participatory mapping as it scored less on usability and affordability. To improve PP-GIS in these aspects, an easy-to-use mobile and web based, free and open source PP-GIS solution, Watershed GIS, was developed. It scored better than the three existing solutions and its usage resulted in substantial reduction of variability in criteria values and thus better ranking of alternatives, with the average coefficient of variation decreasing from 0.12 to 0.05.	10.1080/13658816.2016.1206202	WOS:000392593400003	2017	A participatory framework for developing public participation GIS solutions to improve resource management systems
16	Data for biophysically modeled and Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS)-derived cultural ecosystem services have potential to identify natural resource management synergies and conflicts, but have rarely been combined. Ecosystem service hot/coldspots generated using different methods vary in their spatial extent and connectivity, with important implications. We map biophysically modeled and PPGIS-derived cultural services for six U.S. national forests using six hot/coldspot delineation methods. We evaluate the implications of hotspot methods for management within and outside of designated wilderness areas. We used the ARIES and SolVES modeling tools to quantify four biophysically modeled and 11 largely cultural ecosystem services for six national forests in Colorado and Wyoming, USA. We mapped hot/coldspots using two quantile methods (top and bottom 10 and 33 % of values), two area-based methods (top and bottom 10 and 33 % of area), and two statistical methods (Getis-Ord Gi* at alpha = 0.05 and 0.10 significance level) and compare results within and outside wilderness areas. Delineation methods vary in their degree of conservatism for hot/coldspot extents and spatial clustering. Hotspots were more common in wilderness areas in national forests near the more densely populated Colorado Front Range, while coldspots were more common in wilderness areas in more urban-distant forests in northwest Wyoming. Statistical hotspot methods of intermediate conservatism (i.e., Getis-Ord Gi*, alpha = 0.10 significance) may be most useful for ecosystem service hot/coldspot mapping to inform landscape scale planning. We also found spatially explicit evidence in support of past findings about public attitudes toward wilderness areas.	10.1007/s10980-016-0430-6	WOS:000392301500007	2017	Evaluating alternative methods for biophysical and cultural ecosystem services hotspot mapping in natural resource planning
17	In this paper we explore notions of within-group language variation in a Tzotzil Maya town of Chiapas, Mexico. Integrating GIS mapping, cultural domain analysis, and ethnographic research we find that the Tzotzil of Chenalho hold a center-diffusion model of language variation in their municipality. We show that, counter to dichotomous models of identity, people see variation between communities as continuous and use spatial distances as a proxy for estimating linguistic differences. However, contrary to our expectations, people do not estimate linguistic distances from their own community; instead, they use the presumed pre-conquest center of the larger ethnic group as a point of reference from which variation emerges. Estimations are further influenced by a notion of a linguistically homogeneous center as well as by socio-political knowledge and stereotypes. These findings suggest that spatial cognition, combined with social and historical factors, may play a pivotal role in processes of identity formation and maintenance. Linguistic ideologies inscribe both deeply buried histories as well as people's conceptualization of space and their place in it. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

18	Readily available high resolution data on population distribution is an important resource for monitoring human environment interactions and for supporting planning and management decisions. Using a grid that approximates population density over the entire country seems like the most practical approach to exploring and distributing detailed population data but instead data based on census aggregation units is still the most widely used method. In this paper we describe the construction of 30 m resolution grid representing the distribution of population in 2010 over the entire conterminous United States. The grid is computed using 2010 U.S. Census block level population counts disaggregated by a dasymetric model that uses land cover (2011 NLCD) and land use (2010 NLUD) as ancillary data. Detailed descriptions of the ancillary data and dasymetric model are given. Methods of computing the grid are presented followed by an extensive assessment of model accuracy. Overall the expected value for relative error of the model is 44% which is at the lower limit of errors reported for other continental-sized, high resolution population grids. We also offer a more specific error estimate for areas with specified value of population density. Using two example areas, one highly urbanized and another rural, we demonstrate the advantages of using the gridded population data over the census block-based data. Our 30 m population grid is available for online exploration and for download from the custom-made GeoWeb application SocScape at http://sil.uc.edu. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

19	Most current approaches focused on vulnerability, resilience, and adaptation to climate change frame gender and its influence in a manner out-of-step with contemporary academic and international development research. The tendency to rely on analyses of the sex-disaggregated gender categories of 'men' and 'women' as sole or principal divisions explaining the abilities of different people within a group to adapt to climate change, illustrates this problem. This framing of gender persists in spite of established bodies of knowledge that show how roles and responsibilities that influence a person's ability to deal with climate-induced and other stressors emerge at the intersection of diverse identity categories, including but not limited to gender, age, seniority, ethnicity, marital status, and livelihoods. Here, we provide a review of relevant literature on this topic and argue that approaching vulnerability to climate change through intersectional understandings of identity can help improve adaptation programming, project design, implementation, and outcomes.	10.1007/s13280-016-0827-0	WOS:000392285000012	2016	Enhancing and expanding intersectional research for climate change adaptation in agrarian settings
20	This paper examines the outcomes of a Geodesign approach to training undergraduates and graduate students in environmental design and related professions. The focus of this paper is on the role of Geode sign in generalist environmental design training. This paper is organized in three parts. First, it describes a conceptual framework for Geodesign that seats it within a context of theory and practice. Second, we present a case study of the University of Colorado Geodesign program, including, at the time under review in this case, undergraduate and masters programs in architecture, landscape architecture and planning. Third, we reflect back both on the conceptual framework and the experience of the University of Colorado. In this research we developed an instrument with which to evaluate final class projects, and assess learning outcomes of beginning and advanced studios, special topics classes and Geodesign modules. While a number of Geodesign programs are underway relatively little has been written about Geodesign pedagogy. This paper explores issues and opportunities in Geodesign education based on the University of Colorado case. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

21	The sociocultural approach attempts to compensate for values that tend to be obscured by economic valuations of ecosystem services. GIS-based public participation tools are expected to be useful to include public perception into the ecosystem assessments, but there are still problems transforming qualitative information into quantitative values in practical use. This study evaluated stakeholders' subjective valuations of ecosystem service bundles in relation to biophysical and socioeconomic factors in a subject-applicable study area. A mail-based survey was conducted by sending questionnaires to communities in the Kushiro watershed, northern Japan. The respondents were asked to allocate a virtual fund to 10 individual ecosystem services for potential land management and indicate the locations corresponding to their preferred management measures on a provided map. Respondents highly valued provisioning and cultural services, followed by regulating and supporting services. The results of Tobit models indicated the correlational influence of respondents' characteristics and familiarity with the surrounding environment. In addition, the results of a spatial analysis depicted a considerable degree of spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of the perceived values in relation to landscape structures. Thus, social values of ecosystem service bundles should be analyzed from the perspectives of diverse stakeholders representing a variety of socioecological contexts.	10.1016/j.ecoser.2016.10.009	WOS:000390691200015	2016	Local perception of ecosystem service bundles in the Kushiro watershed, Northern Japan - Application of a public participation GIS tool
22	This essay offers paths for scholars influenced by the critical social sciences and theoretical humanities to contribute to the construction of concepts and digital practices of data that will allow data to better align with their approaches to scholarly inquiry. In particular, it explores how geographic information might be refashioned, rereading it from simplified theoretical positions drawn from interpretative inquiry, process-relational thought, and new materialisms. Geographic information has largely called forth self-sufficient entities that have intensive properties, are indexed by location in an absolute space, and are known objectively through a geographic gaze. By contrast, this article suggests ways geographic information may be reimagined to constitute spaces as relational, matter as vibrant, and/or knowledge as situated. If all claims are seen as interpretative, the boundaries between what were previously considered the roles for reader, researcher, data structures, observer, and observed may also need to be reordered, with implications for the ways that we interface with data. Although such paths can be difficult to travel, they hold promise for extending the reach of interpretative and (non-positivist) empirical practice as well as favorably altering the terms on which interpretative scholars can participate in debates around, and practices of, data today.	10.1177/0263775816665118	WOS:000388863900002	2016	Toward speculative data
23	Underground utility incidents, such as utility conflicts and utility strikes, result in time and cost overruns in construction projects, property damages, environmental pollution, personnel injuries, and fatalities. A main cause of recurrent utility incidents is the noncompliance with the spatial configurations between utilities and their surroundings. Utility specifications usually contain textual descriptions of the spatial configurations. However, detection of spatial defects, according to the textual descriptions, is difficult and time consuming. This deficiency is because of the lack of spatial cognition in many rule-checking systems to process massive amounts of data. This study aims to automate utility compliance checking by integrating natural language processing (NLP) and spatial reasoning. NLP algorithm translates the textual descriptions of spatial configurations into computer-processable spatial rules. Spatial reasoning executes the extracted spatial rules following a logical order in a geographical information system (GIS) to identify noncompliance. The intellectual contribution of this study is twofold. First, complex spatial rules are retrieved automatically from textual data with their hierarchies classified, which provides the inputs and indicates the sequence of rule execution in spatial reasoning. Second, semantic spatial relations are modeled on the basis of their metric and topological implications, enabling the automatic execution of multiple spatial rules. Experiments were conducted to test this framework. The average precision, recall, and combination of the two (F-measure) achieved by the NLP algorithm for extracting spatial rules are 87.88%, 79.09%, and 83.25%, respectively. In addition, the spatial reasoning mechanism also was found to be a powerful tool for compliance checking under various scenarios.	10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001199	WOS:000388622900012	2016	Integrating Natural Language Processing and Spatial Reasoning for Utility Compliance Checking
24	From nano-plastics to large sunken vessels, marine debris presents a threat to humans and ecosystems worldwide. Fishermen's knowledge of the sources of, and risks posed by medium to large debris derived from fishing, aquaculture, and other marine industries provides important context for debris mitigation. Public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) can address these risks by integrating subjective and objective spatial data on human and environmental impacts and risks. We integrated fishermen's perceptions and experiences with marine debris with spatial data using PPGIS. We developed a georeferenced database of fishermen's experiences with marine debris, collected during focus groups and at various other meetings in Southwest New Brunswick. This layer was used to integrate baseline data with subjective perceptions of the ecological, economic, and navigational risks associated with marine debris in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. We also documented the physical, technical, political, and regulatory challenges to marine debris mitigation. These challenges highlight the social and environmental processes that complicate any projects that attempt to develop uncontested spatial representations of marine debris. Finally, we discuss the potential of PPGIS to address these challenges by fostering communication, coordinating various marine activities, helping stakeholders set priorities for clean-up, and implementing collaborative clean-up projects.

27	Ever since behavioural geographers started working with place perception; and Peter Gould and Kevin Lynch used mental maps to explore city visualization and spatial preferences, participation has become an integral part of geographical research. Later, when Robert Chambers and others introduced maps into Participatory Rural Appraisal, Participatory GIS and Public Participation GIS were also recognized by quantitative geographers as research methods and visualization tools. In the era of smartphones and global Internet coverage, applications such as FixMyStreet, ArcGIS Online, CartoDB and Maptioannaire allow users to cross the technology gap and become neocartographers without the need for GIS knowledge. GeoParticipation based on using spatial tools in order to involve citizens in community participation can be the future development of Public Participation GIS as it provides an easy-to-use environment and social engagement while creating the feeling of belonging to a certain social group or community. The paper presents a historical review of participatory approaches to the creation of maps, while focusing on the changing role of citizens; from being the objects of geographical research to being the creators of the agenda as well as decision-makers within their communities. Maps were always used as tools of power, but there is a visible shift in the (map) power structures, from maps created by experts and state administration representatives towards maps created by people and their users.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1243862	WOS:000392838300003	2016	From Mental Maps to GeoParticipation
28	This paper reviews persistent principles of participation processes. On the basis of a review of recent interrogations of the (Public) Participatory Geographic Information Systems (P)PGIS and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) approaches, a summary of five prevailing principles in participatory spatial information handling is presented. We investigate these five principles that are common to (P) PGIS and VGI on the basis of a framework of two dimensions that govern the participatory use of spatial information from the perspective of people and society. This framework is presented as a shared perspective of (P) PGIS and VGI and illustrates that, although both share many of these same principles, the ways in which these principles are approached are highly diverse. The paper ends with a future outlook in which we discuss the inter-connected memes of potential technological futures, the signification of localness in 'local spatial knowledge', and the ramifications of ethical tenets by which PGIS and VGI can strengthen each other as two sides of the same coin.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1227552	WOS:000392838300004	2016	A Shared Perspective for PGIS and VGI
29	Participatory GIS (PGIS) was borne out of the cauldron of the GIS and Society debates and the social theoretic critique of GIS. The form and practice of PGIS continues to reflect its origins. At its core PGIS remains focused on integrating local knowledge that is multivalent, equivocal, and often conflictual within a reductionist GIS technology and extensive Spatial Data Infrastructure. Recent conceptual developments in deep mapping and spatial storytelling have the potential to advance the representation of community knowledge through participatory deep mapping. Deep mapping explicitly recognizes that social life is contingent, implicated, and unpredictable. In representing a critical engagement between Geographic Information Science (GISc) and community knowledge and representation, deep mapping potentially challenges the misalignment in representing community knowledge in GIS and in bending geospatial technologies to the needs of communities.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1243864	WOS:000392838300005	2016	From PGIS to Participatory Deep Mapping and Spatial Storytelling
30	This article will focus on the changes in time, technology and data that have affected traditional partner relationships using participatory geographic information systems (PGIS). Project development roles of reliance held by the community, and managed by university agents, has shifted from cooperative to, in some cases, complete independence. The modern model of citizen participation includes a resident-planner toolkit with greater access to neighbourhood data and low-to high-tech analytical tools. Many community-led quality of life studies have a limited scope and focus on policy issues that do not serve a larger constituency. Many neighbourhood plans exclude self-reported neighbourhood knowledge and, due to the frequency of municipal reporting cycles, leaves gaps and data mismatch. Given this, the traditional public participation GIS (PPGIS) model may be less data driven due to a more mission-driven resident-led PGIS solution. Planners in practice and in academia have raised levels of concern about data standards, interoperability, reliability, error and metadata. How and why Citizen Science influenced the progression of PPGIS, participation GIS, crowdsourcing and now community-managed data in both theory and practice are provided. This paper will reflect on how top-down strategies to include neighbourhood knowledge are being reframed by the United States Federal Community of Practice. The future of data integration focuses on both the process and products of data development from both the bottom-up and top-down perspectives.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1243863	WOS:000392838300006	2016	Upside-Down GIS
31	Since 1996, participatory GIS (PGIS) has facilitated avenues through which public participation can occur. One of the ways practitioners articulate social change associated with PGIS interventions has been to qualify success using the term 'empowerment'. This paper explores the extent to which PGIS academic literature has utilised, defined, measured, and analysed empowerment. This research will demonstrate the degree to which PGIS has, from 1996 to 2014, appropriately and adequately taken into account the causative and direct relationship between a PGIS intervention and empowerment. This article identifies works broadly dealing with PGIS, then searches within that subset of literature for the term 'empowerment.' The findings are both quantitatively and qualitatively assessed to explore the trends within the PGIS literature over time and to contextualise the ways in which empowerment has been identified, understood, and articulated. We conclude with a discussion on the extent to which future PGIS research and practice has the ability to disrupt power inequalities.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1209624	WOS:000392838300007	2016	Powering Up
47	Recent revelations of dragnet surveillance by governments around the world have brought attention to privacy and surveillance in their many forms. In this article, we outline the technical mechanisms of geosurveillance to synthesize and inform on a constantly moving target. Despite their interconnections and overlap, to simplify and elucidate these geosurveillance mechanisms, we classify them into three parts: geolocation, unique identification, and the surveillance medium. We show that together they constitute a language that we, as subjects, did not choose yet are increasingly forced to negotiate. Moreover, these mechanisms are both numerous and highly complex and are only one component within large ecosystems of geosurveillance, making privacy ever more evasive. Understanding the mechanisms of our own subjection is integral to any prospects for intervention, however. As such, we highlight the Tor network as an example of resistance to geosurveillance that is enabled by acutely understanding the hypertechnical language that otherwise binds us. Indeed, as we emphasize throughout, mechanism matters.	NA	WOS:000382326900006	2016	Mechanism Matters
32	Equitable access to local geospatial data continues to pose challenges to the knowledge production efforts of marginalized citizen groups. While local government agencies have provided greater access to public data sets through their internet Geographic Information System (GIS) sites, data cannot always be downloaded and used directly by citizens. Past research demonstrates that data sharing at the local level can be a challenging task, mired by legal, institutional, and personal issues. Despite the hype about open data in government, its acceptance and implementation is slow at the local scale. The need for a centralized data repository system at the local scale is thus crucial. This research explores the recent groundbreaking effort to establish a state-wide geospatial portal among the 26 University of Wisconsin (UW) library systems. Through a survey and follow up interviews conducted among public land information professionals in Wisconsin, we find that GIS professionals in local and county governments are open to data sharing through a common geospatial portal. Simultaneously, the efforts to introduce open source GIS software and technical skills through workshops conducted by the library staff demonstrate new ways to facilitate Public Participation GIS (PPGIS). Our research thus demonstrates that university libraries can emerge as an effective model for advancing PPGIS through geoportals, web services, and data and applications in the cloud.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1227567	WOS:000392838300008	2016	Facilitating PPGIS Through University Libraries
33	Mapping spatial information to represent indigenous knowledge (IK) and rights has been taking place since the early 1970s in various parts of Canada. These mapping initiatives continue to be primarily associated with traditional land-use (TLU) studies and have deep roots in participatory methods that include aspects of participatory geographic information systems (PGIS). In the current context of encroaching industrial developments into indigenous homelands and the strengthening of Indigenous rights within Canadian Supreme Court rulings, the role of mapping TLU information is central. Who is conducting the research, what tools are used, and how this information is shared are all key questions being asked in the Indigenous context. As a result, the quality of spatial data has become a critical part of these engagement processes. This paper focuses on the intersections of new methods of TLU/IK data collection, namely a direct-to-digital approach that seeks to minimize misrepresentation and mistranslations of IK. From these intersections, the authors recognize the need to establish Indigenous-led quality indicators that directly address the introduction of new methods into the TLU/IK field. Indigenous geographic information and spatial data quality indicators will better address the current needs of Indigenous communities in the negotiation of resource developments in their territories, and provide a new path forward for enhancing the use of geospatial technologies in Indigenous communities.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1190146	WOS:000392838300009	2016	Mapping the Digital Terrain
34	Social environmental injustice could directly influence children's physical activity and weight, but also indirectly through changing their psychosocial processes. This study aims to assess spatially continuous physical and social environments and to examine the impact of psychosocial stress on the complex interaction between children and obesogenic environments in three Eastern Alabama counties. The obesogenic environment is defined with particular physical, social, and economic characteristics, causing higher risk of being overweight or obese. Survey questionnaires were collected for 690 children in grades K-6 at six schools to measure children's weight, height, socio-demographics, and home locations. Physical activity, psychosocial stress, and family environment were further gathered from a subsample of children aged 8-13 (n = 65) through extended surveys. GIS and statistical methods were used to assess multilevel environments at family, community, and school levels. The associations between children's physical activity, stress, weight, and physical and social environments were examined by a series of multi-level regression models. Of the sample, 42.3% of the participants were measured as Overweight or obese, much higher than the national rate of 31.8%. High weight clusters were observed in a variety of block groups with diverse physical and social environments. Community physical and social environments exhibited inconsistent even opposite spatial patterns (r = -0.18; p < 0.05). The results of multilevel regression models demonstrated the bidirectional causal interactions of physical activity, psycho social stress, and weight. We also found that family (p < 0.01) and school environments (p < 0.01) were more influential to children's participation in physical activity, psychological wellbeing, and weight status compared to community environments.

35	Marine protected area (MPA) research continues to be dominated by biophysical interests. However, understanding social data, including people's values and preferences, is critical to both effective planning and management and long-term MPA success. Having these social data in a spatial form is essential, given that MPA planning and management increasingly uses marine spatial planning (MSP) approaches to carefully locate and mediate among potentially competing uses in both space and time. An online Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) survey was used to collect spatially explicit information on stakeholder values and management preferences for Australia's remote Kimberley region. The Kimberley coast and marine environment is characterised by a multiplicity of values and preferences. Key values included biological conservation, aesthetics, recreational fishing, Aboriginal culture and heritage, and nature based tourism. Management preferences were dominated by the desire to increase conservation/protection, exclude oil/gas development and commercial fishing, and to increase Aboriginal management. The diversity of values and preferences present suggests potential for conflict over management and permitted uses. Significant associations between value and preference distribution and the Kimberley's five marine protected areas were analysed. Accessibility and respondent familiarity appear linked to value attribution. More accessible MPAs were significantly associated with recreation values while more remote MPAs were characterised by a conservation ethos and general aversion to development. Our research demonstrates that PPGIS enables documentation of spatially explicit social data across large scales, highlighting potential synergies and conflicts in values and permitted uses, in a manner that can readily integrate with ecologically based marine spatial planning processes.

36	Neogeography is the name given to the phenomenon of the vastly expanded Geographic Information Systems (GIS) user base. It consists of a collection of practices, tools and users generally found outside of traditional, authoritative GIS. GIS are computer applications that allow users to contribute geotagged data and to access and utilize geospatial data sets in combination with attribute information for a variety of purposes. This paper investigates questions of whether neogeography furthers the democratization of GIS and if increased access translates to empowerment or, conversely, to further marginalization. The research is interpretative and involves a literature review of the topic and a metasynthesis of recent qualitative research. Metasynthesis involves critical evaluation of data to identify an appropriate research sample and synthesis of findings by a compare-and-contrast exercise followed by reciprocal translation of each study into the other studies to reveal overarching metaphors. This is followed by conclusions and recommendations. The findings show that, depending on circumstances, neogeography can result in the democratization of GIS and geospatial data but may also constitute new methods of exclusion depending on technological and societal barriers. Neogeography can also result in empowerment, but this is difficult to define and is often highly contingent on local context.	10.1080/1369118X.2015.1125936	WOS:000378924100001	2016	Neogeography and the democratization of GIS
37	A significant barrier to the assessment of ecosystem services is a lack of primary data, especially for cultural ecosystem services. Spatial value transfer, also known as benefits transfer, is a method to identify the probable locations of ecosystem services based on empirical spatial associations found in other geographic locations. To date, there has been no systematic evaluation of spatial value transfer methods for cultural ecosystem services identified through participatory mapping methods. This research paper addresses this knowledge gap by examining key variables that influence value transfer for cultural ecosystem services: (1) the geographic setting, (2) the type of ecosystem services, and (3) the land cover data selected for value-transfer. Spatial data from public participation GIS (PPGIS) processes in two regions in Norway were used to evaluate spatial value transfer where the actual mapped distribution of cultural ecosystem values were compared to maps generated using value transfer coefficients. Six cultural ecosystem values were evaluated using two different land cover classification systems GlobCover (300 m resolution) and CORINE (100 m resolution). Value transfer maps based on the distribution of mapped ecosystem values produced strongly correlated results to primary data in both regions. Value transfer for cultural ecosystems appear valid under conditions where the primary data and value transfer regions have similar physical landscapes, the social and cultural values of the human populations are similar, and the primary data sample sizes are large and unbiased. We suggest the use of non-economic value transfer coefficients derived from participatory mapping as the current best approach for estimating the importance and spatial distribution of cultural ecosystem services.

38	The transition from single-media, single-location, and single point-in-time analysis to a Cumulative approach represents a profound challenge - and opportunity - for policy makers, planners, advocates and researchers. These challenges and opportunities are, in part, methodological (e.g., data availability of pollution sources, uncertainty of chemical reactions among multiple pollutants, evaluating combined health effects of multiple environmental stressors). However, the social complexity of this issue has been acknowledged, but not systematically documented and analyzed. As a result, there is a significant gap between the development of cumulative impacts analysis and a limited ability to reap their benefit in resolving environmental justice conflicts. Framing cumulative impacts as a \\wicked problem\\" can help highlight some of the challenges in implementing such approaches and can point the way towards applying these approaches to improving collaboration between policy makers, planners, and advocates. We present two case studies of cumulative impacts analysis in California using socio-spatial mapping and public participatory geographic information system (PPGIS). These cases will illustrate the challenges and opportunities for combining quantitative and socio-spatial science with PPGIS as strategies to address the wicked nature of assessing and acting to address cumulative environmental impacts. The Case studies will emphasize the value of an adaptive, participatory, and transdisciplinary approach as an effective response to the wicked qualities of cumulative impacts themselves. These cases can help planners, policy makers, and community advocates to apply a cumulative impacts approach to their own wicked problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

39	The goal of the present paper is to analyze spatial overlap and social conflicts between mountain bikers and runners in an Urban Green Park. The methodology uses publicly available volunteer geographic information, compiled in a spatial database with places (tracks) where these activities occur, in order to measure the use intensity. Results show: (1) the rate of biker and runner compliance with the park's trails, and (2) places where potential conflicts among users are likely to happen. Profiling user's preferences can help managers and decision makers to design proper infrastructure for outdoor activities. Strategic management errors can be avoided by knowing user preferences in urban parks, and by offering improved conditions which meet the expectations and needs of different user groups. MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS This paper presents an efficient method to detect spatial overlaps between different recreational activities which is useful when financial and personnel resources for monitoring visitors in recreational urban green areas are scarce. The dataset comprises Volunteer Geographic Information, publicly available through web sharing services. It constitutes an alternative or a complementary data base compared to direct survey methods. The study revealed the suitability of this methodological approach for the two most popular outdoor recreation activities within urban parks - mountain biking and running. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40	In order to address the increasing need for improved linkages between different value perspectives, we examine the possibility of integrating two valuation methods: the non-monetary softGlS and monetary hedonic pricing. We find them compatible and their output more comprehensive compared to traditional valuation based on one value perspective. The public participatory softGlS survey delivers information on the perception of urban green spaces, which we use as a criterion for dividing green space categories in a hedonic pricing model. We find that the perception expressed in the survey is generally consistent with the impact on property prices in the case of formal green spaces. However, it is inconsistent when it comes to informal ones: places identified as lacking well-maintained greenery exert a positive influence on property prices, while positively evaluated informal green spaces had no impact at all. We identify the latter as a typical trade-off between different value perspectives: informal green spaces are perceived differently following a monetary and a non-monetary approach.

41	As digital technologies become ubiquitous in many places, scholars of civic engagement, youth and political life, and geographic education have explored the potential of teaching critical and spatial thinking through digital technologies. This paper examines interactive digital mapping as a technology environment for teaching and practicing critical spatial thinking, in relation to civic engagement. From this participatory and dialogic mapping project with teenage girls in Seattle, Washington, we develop a conceptualization of critical spatial thinking that emphasizes how social and spatial processes intertwine to generate societal inequalities and show how this learning informs students' social and spatial civic responses. We show how interactive digital mapping pedagogies offer students an opportunity to develop awareness of what happens in their urban geographies, but also how and what they might do to intervene.	10.1080/14733285.2015.1136736	WOS:000381012300005	2016	Critical spatial learning
401	Recent developments in air pollution epidemiology are generating new data on human air pollution exposure and health effects in the city. Based on regression mapping or land use regression (LUR), these data also provide a new window on the urban political ecology of scale. Air pollution itself is understudied in the emergent urban political ecology literature and in this case it is aided by - indeed must rely upon - GIS/spatial analysis. A case study of Vancouver illustrates the scalar contradictions in regulatory versus LUR measurements and estimates leading us finally to consider the wider implications for urban political ecology and environmental governance.	10.1111/j.1475-5661.2008.00316.x	WOS:000259027200005	2008	A political ecology of scale in urban air pollution monitoring
42	Children's time and freedom for independent neighbourhood activity is severely declining, which may be adversely impacting their healthy development. This study integrates GPS activity monitoring and environmental analysis in a geographic information system with activity diaries, annotated maps, surveys, and map-enhanced interviews to conduct a deep pattern analysis of children's habitual neighbourhood behaviour (n=23; aged 9-13 years) from each an urban and suburban school neighbourhood within London, Canada. Patterns in children's primary activities and settings, independent mobility (IM) levels, and perception and use of neighbourhood affordances are examined. Participants note a diverse range of local independent destinations, but habitually spend little time playing outdoors in neighbourhoods. Local activity related to free time available, perception of activity affordances, and license to travel independently. Social and environmental conditions of children's micro-neighbourhoods influenced independent destinations and domains. Neighbourhood planning should promote diversity of activity affordances and address conditions that support increased IM for youth.	10.1080/14733285.2016.1140126	WOS:000381012300006	2016	Neighbourhood play on the endangered list
43	A high level of road traffic noise during the night can alter individuals' wellbeing. The first objective of this paper is to determine whether the groups that are most vulnerable to road traffic noise, namely children under 15 years old and people aged 65 and over, and the groups most likely to experience high levels of nuisance, namely visible minorities and low-income individuals, are affected by environmental inequities with regard to road traffic noise during the night. The second objective is to identify the sectors where the mean level of noise surpasses the 55 dB(A) tolerance threshold established by the World Health Organization. The methodology for estimating the level of nocturnal road traffic noise is based on a combination of elements of the road and urban environments. All of these parameters have been considered in calculating road traffic noise in the most densely inhabited portion of the Island of Montreal. The results of the statistical tests show that the groups selected on the basis of age are not affected by any environmental inequities. However, areas with more low-income individuals and visible minorities are more likely to be characterized by higher levels of road traffic noise when compared with the rest of the population.	10.1111/cag.12281	WOS:000388361700012	2016	Road traffic noise geography during the night in Montreal
44	While a number of studies have applied public participation GIS (PPGIS) approaches to the spatial assessment of ecosystem services, few have considered the associations between the spatial distribution of ecosystem services and the context-specific nature of self-reported well-being. In this study, we engage the general public to identify and map a range of ecosystem services that originate in place based, local knowledge and explore the context-dependent nature of subjective well-being. We conducted a PPGIS survey with 219 local residents in a Spanish agroforestry (dehesa) landscapes and analysed the spatial patterns of mapped ecosystem services, their relation to land cover, protected area and common land patterns. In addition, we explored the landscape values contributing to people's wellbeing; and the relationships between ecosystem services in different land covers, landscape values and socio-demographic characteristics. A mosaic of landscape types (i.e., the landscape) provided more ecosystem services (especially cultural and provisioning) to people compared with the individual land system of agroforestry. However, land tenure and public access significantly guided the spatial practices and values of the people beyond the preferred landscape types. The contribution of the landscape to well-being is largely related to values based on interactions among people and the landscape, as tranquillity/relaxation and people-people interactions such as being with family and friends. We discuss the specific contribution of agroforestry landscapes to the provision of ecosystem services and human wellbeing. We conclude that the integration of the applied methods of social-cultural assessment on the one hand links to ecosystem services frameworks but on the other hand represents a more holistic conceptualisation of people's benefits from landscapes.

45	As urbanization gathers pace and climate change increases the number and magnitude of many natural hazards, cities are increasingly becoming hot spots for disasters. Although the role of appropriate urban forms in reducing disaster vulnerability has been recognized for some time, the majority of its potential remains focused on long-term mitigation efforts. In contrast, examination of the relationships with short-term disaster management activities such as response and immediate recovery has not been thoroughly conducted. This paper contributes to this shortfall by analysing a critical type of rapid onset disaster, a near-field tsunami, and the role of urban form in supporting the populations' core response activities of evacuation and sheltering. The Chilean city of Iquique (affected by a severe earthquake and minor tsunami in 2014) is examined using a mixed methods approach that provides the basis for proposed macro-scale and micro-scale changes in its urban form; these modifications, in turn, are assessed with geographic information system (GIS) and agent-based computer models. The results show important existing evacuation vulnerability throughout major areas of the city (as the result of interrelated critical conditions), which nonetheless could be significantly reduced by the changes proposed. Further steps in this iterative process, in turn, could lead to the development of evacuation-based urban design standards capable of being transferred to different tsunami-prone contexts around the world.	10.1177/0265813515597229	WOS:000383202500004	2016	An urban form response to disaster vulnerability
46	The emergence of Web 2.0, open source software tools, and geosocial networks, along with associated mobile devices and available government data, is widely considered to have altered the nature and processes of place-based digital participation. Considerable theorizing has been dedicated to the geographic version of Web 2.0, the geospatial Web (Geoweb). To assess the theories, we draw on four years of empirical work across Canada that considers the nature of public participation on the Geoweb. We are driven by the question of how easy or difficult it is to do Geoweb-enabled participation, particularly participation as envisioned by researchers such as Arnstein and planning practitioners. We consider how the Geoweb could transform methods by which citizens and nonprofit organizations communicate with the state on environmental issues that affect their lives. We conduct a meta-analysis of twelve research cases and derive new findings that reach across the cases on how the Geoweb obliges us to redefine and unitize participation. This redefinition reifies existing digital inequalities, blurs distinctions between experts and nonexperts, heterogenizes the state as an actor in the participation process, reassigns participation activities in a participation hierarchy, and distances participation from channels of influence.

423	Although participatory approaches to geographic information system (GIS) use have significantly altered the technological and social practices of GIS-based research and decision making, they have received relatively little attention within discussions of participatory research. This paper examines how participation and representation are negotiated in participatory GIS research through everyday practices of knowledge production. Inclusion and exclusion in the production of knowledge in participatory GIS are mediated within several intersecting arenas of research practice simultaneously, often with contradictory implications, priorities, and outputs.	10.1111/j.1467-9272.2006.00526.x	WOS:000236672900008	2006	Negotiating knowledge production
48	Tajikistan like other mountainous nations in Central Asia faces the dual problem of poverty and exposure to multiple natural hazards such as mass wasting, flooding, and prolonged cold. In this case study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 rural Tajik households in order to characterize their vulnerability and adaptation to prolonged winter cold. The household interviews were supplemented with interviews with village leaders, doctors, and school staff. Key interview themes regarding the road network were then compared with GIS road network analysis of the region. Results suggested that the area is highly vulnerable to the impacts of prolonged cold, which could ultimately be made worse through the unsustainable land-use practices, especially for agricultural and biofuel resources. The combination of unreliable sources of income and lower accessibility to markets in winter results in less ability of the residents of these rural villages to mitigate the impacts of prolonged cold. Analysis of the road network using GIS provided additional evidence for the influence of accessibility on vulnerability to prolonged cold.	10.1007/s11069-016-2394-x	WOS:000380794200024	2016	Vulnerability to prolonged cold
49	This paper presents the findings of a study that used an innovative mixed methods community based participatory research approach that included participatory photo mapping, which combines photography, youth-led neighborhood tours, and advocacy (n = 10); in-depth interviews with youth (n = 21); and spatial analysis of neighborhood factors using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The focus is on youths' descriptions of the meaning and implications of abandoned housing for their own and their   and finally, 4) a breakdown of community control and individual and community vulnerability. The youths' narratives are used to highlight research and practice implications and suggest the need for future youth-engaged, community-partnered intervention research to address the effects of housing abandonment."community's well-being. Youth in this study indicated that abandoned properties signify that no one cares about the neighborhood. A youth-authored version of broken windows theory is presented that can be used to better understand the built environment as an indicator of child and neighborhood well-being. This multi-step cycle, reminiscent of broken windows theory, is as follows: 1) unrepaired signs of incivility signal that no one cares; 2) residents withdraw, become more fearful; 3) untended property becomes \\fair game\\" leading to more crime and incivilities	10.1007/s12187-015-9327-1	WOS:000380155800001	2016	Beyond Broken Windows

51	Built environment is an essential component of traffic safety. Using data from the Georgia Department of Transportation from 2000 to 2007, the authors investigated the influence of built environment on pedestrian crashes in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. A network-based kernel density technique was used to locate the hotspots of pedestrian crashes. An environmental audit was then conducted to provide a qualitative assessment of the built environment within each hotspot. Bivariate analysis and negative binomial models were utilized to examine the influence quantitatively after the road was partitioned into short road segments. Results show more pedestrian crashes were likely to occur on segments with less gradient change and with more public transit stops, and be close to census tracts with more public transit users, fewer seniors, and more linguistically isolated households. The findings emphasize the need for more extensive prevention campaigns around the hotspots and consideration of pedestrian safety in future urban and environmental planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

52	This article introduces an interdisciplinary collaboration that brings together sympathetic trends in qualitative geographic visualization (from the perspective of one author who is a geographer) and contemporary generative artistic practices (from the perspective of the other author, who is an artist and theorist)-attempting to represent a diverse array of creative and multi-modal data through generative and participatory digital methods. We present how this convergence expands categories of meaning, allowing us to explore experiential/embodied as well as creative/imaginative engagements with everyday geographies distinct to a digital age. The article mediates on the idea of mapping the imagination and the ways we imagine quotidian spaces, as well as possibilities for new methods for the analysis and representation of spatial and emotional complexity. We particularly explore strategies of integrating multiple technologies and multiple-modes of representation for mapping and re-mapping complexities of social and creative living in order to help provide alternate ways to imagine, represent and engage different forms of embodied and imaginative geographies. This article presents a case study with the artist Andrew Buckles, in Seattle, Washington, correlating representational and participatory digital data including geospatial, temporal, audio, video as well as electroencephalography readings from brainwave sensors.	10.1007/s10708-015-9638-2	WOS:000382790200006	2016	Imag(in)ing Everyday Geographies
53	Children represent a population group that is much neglected in the city planning process. Their perceptions, which are different from those of adults, are usually not incorporated in the design of cities. The aim of this paper is to present a qualitative GIS approach to capture children's perceptions of the urban environment. It gives a detailed insight into why certain perceptions occur and what the associated physical and social qualities are. The approach considers children as active participants and combines quantitative and qualitative methods. Twenty-eight children aged 10-17 were involved in examining the city-centre area of Enschede, the Netherlands. The results show both similarity and heterogeneity in perception (e.g. based on gender and age group) and the emergence of new location-specific qualities (e.g. natural elements, smart technologies, economic functions). It concludes with a discussion on the potential of incorporating this approach in urban planning processes.	10.1080/14733285.2015.1103836	WOS:000377042300005	2016	Children's perception of their city centre
55	This paper investigates one specific cultural ecosystem service: outdoor recreation. We present a method to map the collective preferences for outdoor recreation and to identify the substitutability among nature sites in the context of the province of Antwerp, Belgium. We propose an indicator of substitutability among nature areas, contrasting unique but poorly substitutable sites (hot spots) with highly substitutable sites (cold spots). Using a combination of survey information, public participation GIS (PPGIS) and kernel density mapping, we produce density surfaces representing the distribution of the collective preferences for outdoor recreation and identify the spatial characteristics of the market (e.g. extent, discontinuities) for outdoor recreation. We also compute Getis-Ord G(i)* spatial statistics to identify local outdoor recreation clusters. In addition, we explore how recreational behaviour affects substitutability. Our results suggest a duality between the social value of outdoor recreation and the level of substitutability among nature sites. Highly substitutable sites tend to be found near areas of higher population density, which are as well highly visited sites. The type of recreational activity - hiking, cycling, dog walking or jogging - appears to substantially modify substitutability patterns among nature sites. We conclude by discussing the methodological implications of this research in the context of stated preference ecosystem service valuation and stress several policy -related implications.

56	Even though global interest in mangrove research has increased in recent years, unveiling their immense ecological and economic roles, very little work has been done to investigate the primary driving factors motivating long-term community-based mangrove restoration and management on local scales. In Ghana, policy makers and coastal management practitioners have recently embraced the concept of community-based and co-management of coastal and marine resources. Community-based and co-management approaches require that key stakeholders, most notably the resource users themselves, play significant roles and responsibilities in the management process. However, there is little evaluation of the process in Ghana to assess the success or otherwise, particularly of the few and long standing examples of community-based approaches in coastal resource management. With special reference to an over two decade old community-based mangrove forestry programme along the Volta estuary of Ghana, this paper provides concepts for examination of the ecological and socioeconomic factors influencing mangrove restoration and management by fishers, fish mongers, farmers and their socioeconomic groupings. Participatory GIS mapping and the use of orthophotos generated for the period 1974-2011 provided additional information on temporal evolution of the extent of mangrove areas restored and managed by local stakeholders. Socioeconomic assessment of mangrove products utility was done through questionnaire interviews. The results indicate that livelihoods and economic benefits are the primary factors that motivate local stakeholders' participation in mangrove restoration and management. Mangroves provisioning services, markets and low livelihoods diversification are major drivers of mangrove resources exploitation. The study has shown that mangroves resources can be sustainably exploited, restored and managed if local customary rules are enforced and institutional arrangements put in place to mediate mangrove exploitation and regeneration rates. Such an approach if well developed, could promote coastal resources conservation with high economic returns for the users. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

57	Visitors' assessments of the negative impact of tourism, on physical and social environment, vary based on the location where the evaluation occurs. Research that focuses on identifying visitors' norms within outdoor recreation settings has not been able to link the geographical location with the corresponding evaluation of unacceptable levels of impact. This study combines a traditional on-site visitor survey with a Public Participation Geographic Information Systems survey to produce spatially explicit information on visitors' acceptance of tourism impacts. Using a web-based participatory survey, visitors were asked to indicate specific locations where they felt the effects of tourism disturbed the quality of their experience in Oulanka National Park. These evaluations were analyzed at multiple scales - destination, specific zones, and sites - to promote more efficient park management. Based on visitor evaluations, we found a collection of hotspots in the park where tourism has already caused unacceptable impacts. Visitors noted that crowding and erosion disturbed their experiences, especially along highly visited trail sections, while littering was considered problematic near wilderness huts. However, participant satisfaction at these sites was not lower than elsewhere in the park. This indicates that the association between negative impacts of tourism and visitor satisfaction is not straightforward, but complex. This study encourages the collection of spatially accurate data on visitors' assessments of the effects of tourism because it has the potential to more efficiently direct park management policies. In addition, spatial techniques provide a new means to monitor the impacts of tourism, acknowledging that visitors' perceptions of acceptability of tourism impacts also vary within tourism destinations, such as parks.	10.1080/14616688.2016.1169313	WOS:000375291400002	2016	Visitors' place-based evaluations of unacceptable tourism impacts in Oulanka National Park, Finland
58	Lack of reliable techniques for large-scale monitoring of disease-transmitting mosquitoes is a major public health challenge, especially where advanced geo-information systems are not regularly applicable. We tested an innovative crowd-sourcing approach, which relies simply on knowledge and experiences of residents to rapidly predict areas where disease-transmitting mosquitoes are most abundant. Guided by community-based resource persons, we mapped boundaries and major physical features in three rural Tanzanian villages. We then selected 60 community members, taught them basic map-reading skills, and offered them gridded maps of their own villages (grid size: 200mx200m) so they could identify locations where they believed mosquitoes were most abundant, by ranking the grids from one (highest density) to five (lowest density). The ranks were interpolated in ArcGIS-10 (ESRI-USA) using inverse distance weighting (IDW) method, and re-classified to depict areas people believed had high, medium and low mosquito densities. Finally, we used odor-baited mosquito traps to compare and verify actual outdoor mosquito densities in the same areas. We repeated this process for 12 months, each time with a different group of 60 residents. All entomological surveys depicted similar geographical stratification of mosquito densities in areas classified by community members as having high, medium and low vector abundance. These similarities were observed when all mosquito species were combined, and also when only malaria vectors were considered. Of the 12,412 mosquitoes caught, 60.9% (7,555) were from areas considered by community members as having high mosquito densities, 28% (3,470) from medium density areas, and 11.2% (1,387) from low density areas. This study provides evidence that we can rely on community knowledge and experiences to identify areas where mosquitoes are most abundant or least abundant, even without entomological surveys. This crowd-sourcing method could be further refined and validated to improve community-based planning of mosquito control operations at low-cost.	10.1371/journal.pone.0156388	WOS:000377218700023	2016	Crowdsourcing Vector Surveillance
59	An Internet-based public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) is an affordable and accessible tool for citizens to provide location-based volunteered geographic information (VGI) in environmental planning and management. Based on a conceptual model, this study uses the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis methodology to qualitatively evaluate user, information, and site use of six cases with Internet-based PPGIS. This study reviews each case's website to collect descriptive data for the case analysis. The results of this study show that user numbers do not have a significantly strong relationship with data submission numbers, since active users had the highest number of contributions. The most urgent task of using Internet-based PPGIS to attract citizen scientists is to invite and retain long-term and active contributors, and to change interested users into long-term active contributors.	10.1080/09640568.2015.1054477	WOS:000373628400007	2016	Evaluating Internet-based public participation GIS (PPGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI) in environmental planning and management
60	Considerable amounts of geographical data are still collected not in form of GIS data but just as natural language texts. This paper proposes an approach for the automatic geocoding of itineraries described in natural language. This approach needs as an input a text annotated with part-of-speech and geo-semantic tags. The proposed method is divided into three main steps. First, we build a complete graph where vertices represent locations, and all vertices are connected to each other by undirected edges. We assign a weight to all the edges of the complete graph using a multi-criteria analysis approach. Then we compute a minimum spanning tree to obtain an undirected acyclic graph connecting all vertices. And finally, we transform this graph into a partially directed acyclic graph in order to identify the sequence of waypoints and build an approximation of a plausible footprint of the itinerary described. Additionally, the rationale of the proposed approach has been verified with a set of experiments on a corpus of hiking descriptions.	10.1080/13658816.2015.1108422	WOS:000372206600005	2016	Reconstruction of itineraries from annotated text with an informed spanning tree algorithm
61	This paper develops a theoretical and conceptual framework for research on urban geographies of food and dietary health. This framework conceptualizes urban dietary health inequities as produced relationally through multiscalar social, political, economic, and biological processes intersecting in place-specific ways. It synthesizes perspectives from spatial analytical food access research, relational health geographies, political ecologies, and critical geographic information science (GIS). Recognizing the importance of relational, dynamic conceptions of both spatial context and human health, it suggests extending current approaches by integrating critical GIS methodologies for producing alternative spatial representations and political ecology's theorization of urban spaces as produced through the intersection of multiscalar social and ecological processes. Reflecting political ecological and critical GIS perspectives, it also emphasizes that (spatial) knowledge production processes materially impact urban environments and human health.	10.1111/gec3.12268	WOS:000378435400003	2016	Mapping Urban Geographies of Food and Dietary Health
62	Sketch mapping has been an important data collection technique for geographers since the 1960s. Structured sketch mapping requires participants to draw spatial data onto a base map containing cartographic information, in order to assist with spatial referencing. A concern that base map characteristics may influence sketch map content has been raised repeatedly in the research literature. However little scholarly attention has been paid to systematically testing the effect of base maps. This paper aims to test the effects of base map size and imagery on structured sketch maps of avoidance behaviour in university students. Using an experimental design, 272 sketch maps were compared for differences in: sketch map style; the location of collective avoidance hotspots; the extent of the reported area avoided; the number of reported areas avoided; the intensity of avoidance; and the tortuosity of sketch map features. No significant differences were found between base maps in sketch map style or the size, intensity or number of areas avoided. Provision of larger base maps caused respondents to draw more detailed sketch maps. Collective avoidance hotspots shifted location slightly between base maps, probably due to difficulties interpreting aerial photographs. Sketch map content appears to be remarkably robust to changes in base map. Base maps appear to assist respondents with spatial referencing rather than cueing respondents to report specific features.

63	River flooding is a serious hazard in the UK with interest driven by recent widespread events. This paper reviews different approaches to flood risk management and the borders (physical, conceptual and organisational) that are involved. The paper showcases a multi-method approach to negotiating flood risk management interventions. We address three fundamental issues around flood risk management: differences and similarities between a variety of approaches; how different approaches work across borders between professionals, lay people, organisations and between different planning regimes; and, whether the science evidence base is adequate to support different types of flood risk management. We explore these issues through a case study on the River Tweed using Q methodology, community mapping and focus groups, participatory GIS, and interviews, which enabled co-production of knowledge around possible interventions to manage flooding. Our research demonstrated that excellent networks of practice exist to make decisions about flood risk management in the Scottish-English borders. Physical and organisational borders were continually traversed in practice. There was an overwhelming desire from professional flood managers and local communities for an alternative to simply structural methods of flood management. People were keen to make use of the ability of catchments to store water, even if land needed to be sacrificed to do so. There was no difference in the desire to embrace natural flood management approaches between people with different roles in flood management, expertise, training or based in different locations. Thus conceptual borders were also crossed effectively in practice.	10.1007/s11069-016-2284-2	WOS:000376430700005	2016	Flood risk management, an approach to managing crossborder hazards
64	This paper presents innovative ways to relate survey data to GIS maps, thereby making the connection of people and place more accessible for the research community. Based on data from rural areas in the Brazilian Amazon, we describe a successful effort to sample households while linking farm-level data to property boundaries, these boundaries generated from subjects' interpretations of satellite images on a computer screen. The sampling framework is based on legislation requiring farmers to report to a government agency in a four-week period, and the farmers' input allows for a more efficient means of identifying property boundaries as compared to GPS. We show that the resulting sampling is statistically representative. We discuss the potential of this association of institutional design and low-cost methods of data collection to allow for more cost-effective generation of spatial data and of geospatial analysis.	10.1007/s11111-015-0249-0	WOS:000376024600001	2016	5 GIS without GPS

66	Background: Given the challenges of aging populations, calls have been issued for more sustainable urban re-development and implementation of local solutions to address global environmental and healthy aging issues. However, few studies have considered older adults' daily mobility to better understand how local built and social environments may contribute to healthy aging. Meanwhile, wearable sensors and interactive map-based applications offer novel means for gathering information on people's mobility, levels of physical activity, or social network structure. Combining such data with classical questionnaires on well-being, physical activity, perceived environments and qualitative assessment of experience of places opens new opportunities to assess the complex interplay between individuals and environments. In line with current gaps and novel analytical capabilities, this research proposes an international research agenda to collect and analyse detailed data on daily mobility, social networks and health outcomes among older adults using interactive web-based questionnaires and wearable sensors. Methods/Design: Our study resorts to a battery of innovative data collection methods including use of a novel multisensor device for collection of location and physical activity, interactive map-based questionnaires on regular destinations and social networks, and qualitative assessment of experience of places. This rich data will allow advanced quantitative and qualitative analyses in the aim to disentangle the complex people-environment interactions linking urban local contexts to healthy aging, with a focus on active living, social networks and participation, and well-being. Discussion: This project will generate evidence about what characteristics of urban environments relate to active mobility, social participation, and well-being, three important dimensions of healthy aging. It also sets the basis for an international research agenda on built environment and healthy aging based on a shared and comprehensive data collection protocol.	10.1186/s12877-016-0273-7	WOS:000375806200001	2016	Understanding the role of contrasting urban contexts in healthy aging
67	Wayfinding, or the ability to plan and navigate a course over the landscape, is a subject of investigation in geography, neurophysiology, psychology, urban planning, and landscape design.(1-4) With the prevalence of GPS-assisted navigation systems, or \\wayfinders,\\" computer scientists are also increasingly interested in understanding how people plan their movements and guide others. However, the importance of wayfinding as a process that regulates human mobility has only recently been incorporated into archeological research design.(5,6) Hominin groups were able to disperse widely during the course of prehistory. The scope of these dispersals speaks to the innate navigation abilities of hominins. Their long-term success must have depended on an ability to communicate spatial information effectively. Here, we consider the extent to which some landscapes may have been more conducive to wayfinding than others. We also describe a tool we have created for quantifying landscape legibility (sensu Gollege(2)), a complex and under-explored concept in archeology, with a view to investigating the impact of landscape structure on human wayfinding and thus, patterns of dispersal during prehistory. To this end, we have developed a method for quantifying legibility using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and apply it to a test case in prehistoric Iberia."	10.1002/evan.21484	WOS:000382937900008	2016	Reading the Landscape
68	Detailed habitat maps are critical for conservation planning, yet for many coastal habitats only coarse-resolution maps are available. As the logistic and technological constraints of habitat mapping become increasingly tractable, habitat map comparisons are warranted. Here we compare two mapping approaches: local environmental knowledge (LEK) obtained from interviews; and remote sensing analysis (RS) of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (2.0 m pixel) using object-based image analysis. For a coral reef ecosystem, we compare the accuracy of these two approaches for mapping shallow seafloor habitats and contrast their characterization of habitat area and seascape connectivity. We also explore several implications for conservation planning. When evaluated using independent ground verification data, LEK-derived maps achieved a lower overall accuracy than RS-derived maps (LEK: 66%; RS: 76%). A comparison of mapped habitats found low overall agreement between LEK and RS maps. The RS map identified 5.4 times more habitat edges (the border between adjacent habitat classes) and 3.7-6.4 times greater seascape connectivity. Since the spatial arrangement of habitats affects many species (e.g., movement, predation risk), such discrepancies in landscape metrics are important to consider in conservation planning. Our results help identify strengths and weakness of both mapping approaches for conservation planning. Because RS provided a more accurate estimate of habitat distributions, it would be better for conservation planning for species sensitive to fine-spatial scale seascape patterns (e.g., habitat edges), whereas LEK is more cost effective and appropriate for mapping coarse habitat patterns. Goals for maps used in conservation should be identified early in their development.	10.1002/ecs2.1325	WOS:000377215200030	2016	Mapping for coral reef conservation
69	Rural residents, including elderly, low-income or people with language or physical mobility challenges, may experience transportation disadvantage when land use patterns, built environment and transportation services fail to meet their mobility needs. A technique for identifying transportation-dis-advantaged populations, intended for use by local practitioners and designed with their skills and professional routines in mind, was piloted in five rural counties in North Carolina. Maps showing areas of elevated theoretical risk of transportation disadvantage were constructed by overlaying layers of readily available, Census-based geospatial data, to generate composite maps where increasing intensity of shading denotes populations with multiple risk factors. The maps were used in key informant interviews with local transportation-relevant professionals to access their expert knowledge, and in focus groups with non-expert residents to probe their travel routines and need to access essential goods, services and activities. These multiple data sources supported an iterative process of initial mapping, stakeholder outreach, revised mapping, and continued discussion. Our findings both corroborated some a priori expectations, and yielded unexpected insights into which residents may experience transportation disadvantage and how they respond. The work demonstrates how local knowledge can be used to identify unique or non-spatial components of transportation disadvantage, and underscores the importance of locally specific knowledge to support planning efforts to identify and ultimately to address transportation disadvantage.

77	Maps and mapping are integral elements in the methodological toolbox used by children's geographers studying children's environmental relationships. The advent of new technologies, particularly computer-mapping software, offers immense potential for enhancing understanding and representation of children's everyday spatial relationships. Computerised mapping tools appeal to children and offer new and exciting applications where children can directly demonstrate their ecological knowledge providing evidence that can be used to challenge commonly held notions that city children are disconnected from nature. This paper explores the development of a computer-mapping interface, combining aerial photos and GIS. We argue that the appropriate application of child-oriented methods allows children to demonstrate carefully, meaningfully and effectively their knowledge of nature as it occurs at the micro-scale in their neighbourhoods and in their lives.	10.1080/14733285.2015.1126552	WOS:000370670800003	2016	Technological inroads into understanding city children's natural life-worlds
70	A large proportion of American Indian reservation lands are owned by non-Indian entities. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a powerful tool for visualising land tenure changes, and public participation GIS (PPGIS) is one approach for using spatial technologies to facilitate the identification and reacquisition of reservation lands by tribes. While some tribes have successfully harnessed GIS for land management and for systematically identifying lands for reacquisition, others struggle to implement land management systems such as GIS for these purposes. This paper situates PPGIS in relation to other forms of participatory action research and outlines our use of a PPGIS framework to engage undergraduate geography students in the mapping of land tenure status on ten rural Minnesota Indian reservations as part of a collaborative partnership with the Indian Land Tenure Foundation (ILTF). A PPGIS framework allowed us to collaboratively define research goals in response to tribal community needs and provided structure for student work with partner reservations to develop and implement tailored mapping and analysis techniques. Two sets of findings are significant. First, the assembly of a standardised set of maps for American Indian reservations in Minnesota provides a tremendous visual and analytical resource for ILTF and individual tribes to pursue land reacquisition within reservation boundaries. Second, from a PPGIS perspective, we found that working with a coordinating or bridging' organisation provided key benefits by enabling education of both the student-faculty partners and the individual tribes. The PPGIS model empowered both partners by allowing tribes to harness a powerful technology to assist in visualising land-based assets and allowing students to contribute to native land reacquisition efforts through application of their GIS skills. This mapping helps facilitate economic and cultural viability in tribal communities by providing an important visual catalogue of existing land-based assets, in support of future land acquisition and economic development planning.	10.1111/1745-5871.12167	WOS:000375048400002	2016	Facilitating native land reacquisition in the rural USA through collaborative research and Geographic Information Systems

72	Collaborative online research offers opportunities and constraints for geographers. This article critically appraises a collaborative research process that we used to illuminate spatial and political dynamics of feminism contained within the online group 'Destroy the Joint' (DTJ). A mostly Australian initiative of over 74000 Facebook members, DTJ aims to end sexism and misogyny in multiple ways. It operates as a meeting place, discussion forum, and umbrella organisation for numerous micro-campaigns that change in response to broader social, cultural and political contexts, and occur in online and offline spaces. We formed a collaborative research agreement with the moderators of DTJ to reflect on its work, asking participants to put themselves on a map and complete a survey. Participatory GIS and survey-based research operated in the real and the more-than-real spaces that contain paradoxical possibilities. We use the term more-than-real to highlight the excesses of digital spaces: the affect that social media generates, and is generated by, characterises the more-than-real, where extremes in productive and corrosive relations can permeate. Survey results showed diverse appreciations of DTJ's multiple activist tactics (across seemingly 'superficial' and 'meaningful' interventions), and creative ideas for future campaigns. Mapping revealed both dispersed networks and urban activist concentrations. Nevertheless, after an initial peak of interest and enthusiasm for reflecting on DTJ, the reporting back of research findings to DTJ followers did not garner significant interest. This article tracks that collaborative research trajectory. Intentions to build a hybrid research collective were not realised because of how the more-than-real affords possibilities and limitations. The politics of 'giving-back' within the more-than-real are critically engaged with in this appraisal of an experimental online collaboration.	10.1080/00049182.2016.1138842	WOS:000373214300002	2016	Learning about Feminism in Digital Spaces
73	Public participatory geographic information systems (PPGIS) have been advanced as a means to include those who have been traditionally excluded from numerous place-specific governance activities, including planning and policymaking and as a way to resolve some of the long-standing tensions between critical traditions in human geography and the ever-expanding field of GIS. Despite the rapid adoption of participatory GIS by academics, government officials, and planning professionals, there are few guidelines of best practices for PPGIS researchers and practitioners to draw on and little effort has been made to understand how and in what ways PPGIS efforts are (or perhaps are not) effective. This article contributes to these important debates by evaluating the geography of participation in a recent participatory planning project undertaken in Muncie, Indiana. Using the mapped information that was generated from a series of public meetings, we have identified the presence of significant spatial bias in the process of participation that affected the resulting plan. This was an unexamined source of bias during this process and an example of why any emerging conversations about the best practices for PPGIS must include a consideration of the geography of participation. Los sistemas de informacion geografica participativos publicos (PPSIG) han sido desarrollados como el medio para incluir a quienes tradicionalmente han estado excluidos de numerosas actividades gubernativas de especificidad lugarena, incluyendo la planificacion y la generacion de politicas, y como una manera de resolver algunas de las tensiones de vieja data entre las tradiciones criticas de la geografia humana y el campo de los SIG en permanente expansion. A pesar de la rapida adopcion de los SIG participativos por academicos, agentes del gobierno y profesionales de la planificacion, hay muy pocas guias sobre mejores practicas para ayudar a investigadores y practicantes de PPSIG, y escaso ha sido el intento para entender como y de que manera los esfuerzos de los PPSIG son efectivos (o quizas no). Este articulo contribuye a estos importantes debates evaluando la geografia de la participacion en un reciente proyecto participativo de planificacion emprendido en Muncie, Indiana. Usando la informacion cartografica generada a partir de una serie de reuniones publicas, hemos identificado la presencia de sesgos espaciales significativos en el proceso de participacion, que afectaron el plan resultante. Esta fue una fuente de sesgo no examinada durante el proceso y un ejemplo de por que cualquier conversacion que surja acerca de las mejores practicas de los PPSIG debe tomar en cuenta a la geografia de la participacion.	10.1080/00330124.2015.1054750	WOS:000371810700003	2016	Public Participatory GIS and the Geography of Inclusion
74	OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an online public access database that allows for the collaborative collection of local geographic information. We employ this mapping technology to discuss a new social theory of poverty that moves away from income poverty to an economy that directly produces individuals' basic needs. Focusing on urban farming in Philadelphia as an example, we use OSM to support the argument that money, land, labor, and capital do not limit food production in the city. OSM is a type of commons that allows community members to depict features of interest to them that might otherwise be underrepresented in official or commercially produced maps such as Google Maps. Using the concept of facilitated volunteered geographic information (VGI) we developed an open framework for combining residents' local knowledge of food resources with expert guidance in data input. We believe this helps overcome problems with ad hoc data submission efforts to which collaborative online projects are susceptible. The program for tagging food resources in OSM was deployed in a public map-a-thon event we organized in Philadelphia, bringing together technical experts and food enthusiasts. To share the results, we present the Philly Fresh Food Map as an interactive online Web map that can be used and updated by the public. ??????

El OpenStreetMap (OSM) es una base de datos en red de acceso publico que permite la recoleccion colaborativa de informacion geografica local. Empleamos esta tecnologia cartografica para discutir una nueva teoria social de la pobreza, que se desplaza desde aquella que define la pobreza por el ingreso, hacia una economia que directamente produce las necesidades basicas del individuo. Si nos enfocamos en la agricultura urbana de Filadelfia, como ejemplo, usamos el OSM en apoyo del argumento de que el dinero, la tierra, el trabajo y el capital no limitan la produccion de alimentos en la ciudad. El OSM es un tipo de comunales que permite a los miembros de la comunidad representar rasgos de su interes que de otro modo podrian quedarian mal representados en los mapas oficiales o en los producidos comercialmente, tales como los Mapas Google. Utilizando el concepto de informacion geografica voluntariamente facilitada (VGI) desarrollamos un marco abierto para combinar el conocimiento local de recursos del alimento de los residentes con la guia de un experto en entrada de datos. Creemos que esto ayuda a vencer los problemas relacionados con los esfuerzos de remitir datos ad hoc a los cuales los proyectos urbanos colaborativos son susceptibles. El programa para etiquetar los recursos alimentarios en OSM fue desplegado en un evento publico de mapaton que nosotros organizamos en Filadelfia, en el que reunimos a expertos tecnicos y a entusiastas de los alimentos. Para compartir resultados, presentamos el Mapa Philly Fresh Food, a titulo de mapa Web interactivo en red que puede ser usado y actualizado por el publico.	10.1080/00330124.2015.1065547	WOS:000371810700009	2016	OpenStreetMap and Food Security

76	Background: Emergency departments (ED) recognize crowding and handover from prehospital to in-hospital settings to be major challenges. Prehospital Geographical Information Systems (GIS) may be a promising tool to address such issues. In this study, the use of prehospital GIS data was implemented in an ED in order to investigate its effect on 1) wait time and unprepared activations of Trauma Teams (TT) and Medical Emergency Teams (MET) and 2) nurses' perceptions regarding patient reception, workflow and resource utilization. Methods: Intervention: From May 1st 2014 to October 31th 2014, GIS data was displayed in the ED. Data included real-time estimated time of arrival, distance to ED, dispatch criteria, patient data and ambulance contact information. Data was used by coordinating nurses for time activation of TT and MET involved in the initial treatment of severely-injured or critically-ill patients. In addition, it was used as a logistics tool for handling all other patients transported by ambulance to the ED. Study design: The study followed a mixed-methods design, consisting of a quantitative study (before and after intervention) and a qualitative study (survey and interviews). Participants: Participants included all patients received by TT or MET and coordinating nurses in the ED. Results: 1.) Quantitative: 599 patients were included. The median wait time for TT and MET was 5 min both before and after the GIS intervention, showing no difference (p = 0.18). A significant reduction in the subgroup of waits > 10 min was found (p < 0.05). No difference was found in unprepared TT and MET activations. 2.) Qualitative: Nurses perceived GIS data as a tool to optimize resource utilization and quality of all patients' reception, critically or non-critically ill. No substantial disadvantages were reported. Discussion: The contradiction of measured median wait time and nurses perceived improved timing of team activation may result from having both RT-ETA and supplemental patient information not only for seriously-injured or critically-ill patients received by the TT and MET, but for all patients transported by ambulance. The reduction in waits > 10 minutes may have contributed to the overall perception of reduced wait time, as avoidance of long waits is clinically more important than reduction in the median wait time. Conclusion: A comparison of the use of prehospital GIS data in the ED with the control period showed no effect on median wait time for TT and MET, however, the number of waits of > 10 min was reduced. On the other hand, nurses perceived implementation of GIS data as improving workflow, resource utilization and quality of all patients' reception, critically as well as non-critically ill. There were no substantial disadvantages to the GIS application.	10.1186/s13049-016-0232-5	WOS:000373665100001	2016	Geographic information system data from ambulances applied in the emergency department
78	The unique Hyrcanian (Caspian) forests of northern Iran provide vital ecosystem services for local and global communities. We assess the status and trends of key ecosystem services in this region where native forest conversion has accelerated to make way for housing and farm development. This is a mountainous forested area that is valuable for both conservation and multiple human uses including recreation and farming. It contains globally significant natural habitats for in situ conservation of biological diversity. A rapid, qualitative, and participatory approach was used including interviews with local households and experts in combination with assessment of land use/cover remote sensing data to identify and map priority ecosystem services in the Geographic Information System (GIS). Based on the interests of the beneficiaries, eight priority services (food production, water supply, raw materials, soil conservation, water regulation, climate regulation, biodiversity, and recreation) were identified and mapped. The results indicate the current typical spatial distribution of the provided services based on structural characteristics of the study landscape and their changing trends through a comparison of past, present and future land use, and land cover. Although food production and recreation have greatly increased in recent decades, the other services, in particular timber production, biodiversity, and water purification and supply are being gradually lost. The results of this study and of others elsewhere should raise awareness of ecosystem service status and trends and the value of examining these since they provide much of the information to inform natural resources policy and decision making. The declines in supply of key ecosystem services both within and outside the protected area are creating conflicts within communities as well as impacting on the integrity of the area and careful planning and conservation is required to provide win-win opportunities.	10.3390/f7030051	WOS:000373700800003	2016	Anthropogenic Decline of Ecosystem Services Threatens the Integrity of the Unique Hyrcanian (Caspian) Forests in Northern Iran
79	Context An ecosystem service approach for land-use or conservation decisions normally uses economic or biophysical assessments for valuating nature's services. In contrast, even though ecosystem services are required for human well-being, the actual use of services by differing stakeholder groups are rarely considered in typical ecosystem service assessments, especially the more intangible, cultural ecosystem services. Objectives The aim of this research was to quantify different uses for 15 cultural and provisioning ecosystem service indicators across seven stakeholder groups in a watershed proposed with large hydroelectric dam development. Methods We used a large-scale survey to quantify use and frequency of use for ecosystem services. Results We demonstrate that different stakeholder groups use ecosystem services differently, both in terms of specific ecosystem service indicators, as well as for frequency of ecosystem service use. Across all stakeholder groups, specific cultural ecosystem services were consistently more important to participants when compared to provisioning ecosystem services, especially aesthetic/scenic values. Conclusions This work is of global importance as it highlights the importance of considering cultural ecosystem services (e.g. aesthetic/scenic, sense-of-place values) along with multiple stakeholder groups to identify the trade-offs and synergies during decision-making processes for land-use or conservation initiatives.	10.1007/s10980-015-0260-y	WOS:000372319400006	2016	The inclusion of stakeholders and cultural ecosystem services in land management trade-off decisions using an ecosystem services approach
80	Objective: Analyzing mortality rates and the reasons for these in Turkey's urban allocations using geographic information systems (GISs) is a new research area. While planning health services, knowing the mortality rates and reasons according to age and residential area are a big source of information for health planners and people who provide health services. The aim of this research is to analyze the deaths of children under the age of 5 years in big cities depending on a socioeconomic range using GIS. Further, this should make it possible to determine geographically risky places. Materials and Methods: The deaths of children under the age of 5 years that occurred between 2005 and 2009 were analyzed. Date from the Turkish Statistical Institute (Turk Stat) concerning population and age-specified deaths, Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM) cemetery directorate death records, and the Ministry of Finance land unit prices (to determine the socioeconomic level of the districts) were used as data resources. The Z value of each year's death rate, depending on the districts age ranges and average of all years' Z values, was calculated and is shown on the map. Results: While the under-5 mortality rate was 19.37 per 1000 in 2005, it was 14.31 per 1000 in 2009. Deaths of children under the age of 5 years took place particularly in Istanbul on the European side (in districts where the land value is low). Conclusion: Priority should be given to health promotion programs in areas with a low socioeconomic level in particular where premature death rates are observed to be more common.	10.5152/etd.2016.0044	WOS:000372329600003	2016	Assessment of Under-5 Mortality Rates in Istanbul Using the Geographic Information System

82	Stakeholders are presumed to represent different interests for marine and coastal areas with the potential to influence marine protected area planning and management. We implemented a public participation GIS (PPGIS) system in the remote Kimberley region of Australia to identify the spatial values and preferences for marine and coastal areas. We assessed similarities and differences in PPGIS participants (N = 578) using three operational definitions for \\stakeholder\\" based on: (1) self-identified group, (2) self-identified future interests in the region, and (3) participant value orientation that reflects a preferred trade-off between environmental and economic outcomes. We found moderate levels of association between alternative stakeholder classifications that were logically related to general and place specific participatory mapping behavior in the study region. We then analyzed how stakeholder classifications influence specific management preferences for proposed marine protected areas (MPAs) in the study region. Conservation-related values and preferences dominated the mapped results in all proposed marine reserves, the likely result of volunteer sampling bias by conservation stakeholder interests participating in the study. However, we suggest these results may also reflect the highly politicized process of marine conservation planning in the Kimberley where conservation efforts have recently emerged and galvanized to oppose a major offshore gas development and associated land-based infrastructure. Consistent with other participatory mapping studies, our results indicate that the chosen operational definition for stakeholder group such as group identity versus interests can influence participatory mapping outcomes, with implications for MPA designation and management. Future research is needed to better understand the strengths and limitations of participatory mapping that is framed in stakeholder perspectives, especially when sampling relies heavily on volunteer recruitment and participation methods that appear predisposed to participatory bias. In parallel, practical efforts to ensure that social research efforts such as this are included in MPA planning must remain of the highest priority for scientists and managers alike.

88	GIScience research has enhanced citizen engagement through advancements in web-based geospatial techniques and qualitative GIS methodologies, which provide opportunities for new forms of knowledge production. This paper draws on two interrelated approaches to demonstrate the ways qualitative GIS and Web 2.0 can provide nuanced analysis and foster collaborations to advance, in particular, food justice goals, which include developing equity in access to quality nutritious foods. First, the authors create a multicriteria food environment index utilizing GIS-based multicriteria modeling to represent food environments as constituted by multiple food sources and access dimensions. This enables visualization of food environment quality and indicates that food environment quality varies within a single neighborhood. Second, they utilize web GIS technologies to capture and visualize volunteered geographic information about urban food environments, demonstrating the importance of citizen perspectives to developing more nuanced understandings of these environments.	10.4018/IJAGR.2016010102	WOS:000384523800003	2016	Community-Engaged GIS for Urban Food Justice Research
83	Qualitative GIS is a relatively new methodological approach for analyzing and visualizing qualitative data within a geographic context. Qualitative data can take many forms, including interviews, documents, photographs, and audio and video clips. Content analysis for example, is an effective qualitative method for analyzing text-based data. We argue that basic concepts, (i.e. how to store data, data requirements, visualization techniques, and modes of analysis) within qualitative GIS have not been adequately defined, rendering difficult the replication of work performed and hindering the development of incremental knowledge in the field. Database management systems provide a means for storing, managing, and analyzing qualitative GIS data. A standardized and well-designed open source database system provides a mechanism for qualitative GIS projects, ensuring consistency and project replication. Qualitative GIS data stored in a database allows for additional visualization options, such as geographic word clouds. To demonstrate the concepts we performed content analysis on Master Transportation Plans from Calgary and Montreal using SpatiaLite, an open source database system. We developed Structured Query Language (SQL) queries to generate and populate groups and theme tables within the SpatiaLite database. We present our database design and queries in the hopes that they will help others conducting qualitative GIS research.	10.1111/tgis.12163	WOS:000368797000008	2016	Qualitative GIS
84	Computer programming is not commonly taught to geographers as a part of geographic information system (GIS) courses, but the advent of NeoGeography, big data and open GIS means that programming skills are becoming more important. To encourage the teaching of programming to geographers, this paper outlines a course based around a series of laboratories that aims to provide an introduction to programming. Methods for teaching and assessment are recommended. These laboratories use core spatial concepts that are relevant for all areas of geographic study, and use an open source Python approach that has wider logistical and pedagogical benefits.	10.1080/03098265.2015.1086981	WOS:000371918900011	2016	Teaching introductory GIS programming to geographers using an open source Python approach
85	A question asked at the first national conference on the educational applications of geographical information systems (GIS) in Washington 1994, namely what learning does GIS allow that other ways do not and whether teaching GIS at school level is worth the time and effort required to implement it, remains largely unanswered. Literature searches suggest that little has been done to investigate the effectiveness of GIS in education since this question was raised. In investigating what learning using GIS allows that other ways do not, this study tested whether using GIS as a teaching and learning strategy enabled the promotion of learners spatial cognition and spatial perspective taking abilities better than traditional methods such as using atlases, rulers and calculators do. Four secondary Geography teachers in four Port Elizabeth schools volunteered to take part in the experimental aspects of this study. Empirical data on the development of spatial cognition and spatial perspective taking were generated via their grade 11 Geography learners. Experimental and comparison groups of learners wrote three different types of pre- and post-tests where the experimental groups worked on GIS software with geo-spatial data while the comparison groups used traditional methods. The empirical data generated by the learners revealed that GIS software and geo-spatial data do statistically significantly promote better spatial cognition and spatial perspective taking than traditional methods do.	10.1080/03736245.2014.977815	WOS:000370881000012	2016	The effect of an intervention using GIS-generated geo-spatial data on the promotion of spatial cognition and spatial perspective taking in grade 11 learners
86	An important challenge threatening agriculture in Africa is the difficulty in collecting timely data on disease spread and effectiveness of on-farm control methods. This study served as a case study for assessing the viability of a participatory GIS (Geographic Information System) to enable a plant diagnostics network with fieldworkers. The use of mobile phone applications and a centralized database were integrated to provide a blueprint for how a range of agriculture-focused field organizations can collect data, explain events, predict outcomes and adapt and refine strategies with more accurate, cost-efficient and timely information. Over the course of 2 months, 38 Community Knowledge Workers (CKWs) using mobile phones, MTN Mobile Internet and GPS devices collected 3018 surveys documenting the presence/absence of three banana diseases: Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW), Fusarium Wilt (FW) and Banana Bunchy Top disease (BBTD) in Bushenyi and Mbale districts in Uganda. Costs were saved by only mobilizing CKWs who then trained the communities on methods of banana disease detection, preventative measures and disease control procedures; only when doubts over identification or control occurred did the IITA and NARO technical team then prioritize visits. Although the CKWs provided an efficient and cost-effective information channel that can be leveraged to integrate the efforts of scientists with the needs of rural communities, there were significant gaps in prior farmer knowledge on the three targeted diseases, including how to identify or control them, despite extensive awareness campaigns preceding this initiative. Factsheets used for reference following training greatly improved CKW prior knowledge of disease recognition and control methods; hence, 90% of the surveys conducted during the second month met the data quality standards based on survey completeness, GPS accuracy and quality of symptomatic plant photos. There was significant and consistent demand by farmers for CKW services throughout the pilot period. In-depth training and continuous support of CKWs is thus essential. The technology infrastructure is scalable, and further integration of technology components promises a customizable web-based tool for data collection, GIS analysis, information dissemination and management of agriculture extension operations.	10.1080/07060661.2016.1230149	WOS:000388366700003	2016	Building agricultural networks of farmers and scientists via mobile phones
87	According to the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), federal action to manipulate habitat for species conservation requires an environmental impact statement, which should integrate natural, physical, economic, and social sciences in planning and decision making. Nonetheless, most impact assessments focus disproportionately on physical or ecological impacts rather than integrating ecological and socioeconomic components. We developed a participatory social-ecological impact assessment (SEIA) that addresses the requirements of NEPA and integrates social and ecological concepts for impact assessments. We cooperated with the Bureau of Land Management in Idaho, USA on a project designed to restore habitat for the Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). We employed questionnaires, workshop dialogue, and participatory mapping exercises with stakeholders to identify potential environmental changes and subsequent impacts expected to result from the removal of western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis). Via questionnaires and workshop dialogue, stakeholders identified 46 environmental changes and associated positive or negative impacts to people and communities in Owyhee County, Idaho. Results of the participatory mapping exercises showed that the spatial distribution of social, economic, and ecological values throughout Owyhee County are highly associated with the two main watersheds, wilderness areas, and the historic town of Silver City. Altogether, the SEIA process revealed that perceptions of project scale varied among participants, highlighting the need for specificity about spatial and temporal scales. Overall, the SEIA generated substantial information concerning potential impacts associated with habitat treatments for Greater Sage-Grouse. The SEIA is transferable to other land management and conservation contexts because it supports holistic understanding and framing of connections between humans and ecosystems. By applying this SEIA framework, land managers and affected people have an opportunity to fulfill NEPA requirements and develop more comprehensive management plans that better reflect the linkages of social-ecological systems.	10.5751/ES-08569-210309	WOS:000385720400015	2016	A social-ecological impact assessment for public lands management
89	The Internet provides a new source of information and a new discussion platform for public participation in planning processes. As geographic information systems (GIS) are an essential part of planning practice, equal access to public participation GIS (PPGIS) is crucial for successful stakeholder collaboration. Unfortunately, people with restricted access to computers, limited Internet skills, and poor map literacy could face potential exclusion. Although the older adults' age groups show the strongest growth among Internet users, their general Internet skills remain limited compared to those of younger age groups. Furthermore, little previous research has been conducted on older adults' usage of PPGIS, as current studies focus mainly on older adults' use of the Internet in general or (passive) web maps in particular; PPGIS usability studies generally target a wider audience. In this qualitative and descriptive study, we examine older adults' experience with a PPGIS survey and implement the findings into a final research survey design. The findings support previous results from other Internet or web map usability studies with older adults while, in addition, displaying similarities to the outcomes of general PPGIS usability studies, especially regarding cognitive abilities. Studying older adults draws attention to a vulnerable but growing Internet user group. As other age groups face similar challenges, we suggest that using older adults as a 'test group' for PPGIS usability could help improve the experience for the wider public.	10.1080/13658816.2016.1170837	WOS:000383667800001	2016	Exploring the usability of PPGIS among older adults
90	Current public participation methods are laborious, reach few participants and are ineffective at gathering usable information for planning. This situation leads often to mistrust and dissatisfaction in the process and outcome. This article identifies the critical conditions for meaningful use of public participation GIS (PPGIS) tools to support the making of master plan in Helsinki. With PPGIS tools, residents' insight of their living environment can be reached and utilized along the planning process. The results are divided to conceptual and empirical points. Whereas the conceptual points emphasize better understanding of the locus of the PPGIS tools in planning process, the empirical findings reveal new ways to study how residents' perceptions align with the plan proposal. Though new tools, data and analysis can support representativeness, independence, early involvement, influence and transparency, planners and residents need more understanding of the benefits of these tools. The study indicates that though planners found the collected data and the analysis valuable, they still lacked the skills and institutional motivation to use the data effectively. The results point out that when PPGIS tools can be integrated to the mainstream planning practices, the tools have the ability to evolve to a more comprehensive participatory planning support system.	10.1080/02697459.2015.1104203	WOS:000376261200005	2016	Let the Citizens Map-Public Participation GIS as a Planning Support System in the Helsinki Master Plan Process
91	The emerging ubiquity of geospatial information is providing an unprecedented opportunity to apply Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-based multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to a broad spectrum of use cases. Volunteered geographic information, open GIS software, geoservice-based tools, cloud-based virtualized platforms, and worldwide collaboration of both domain experts and general users have greatly increased the quantity and accessibility of geospatially referenced data resources. Currently, there is a lack of GIS-based MCDA tools that integrate this decision-driven process within a widely accessible, robust geoframework environment, designed for user-friendly interaction. In this contribution, we present a conceptual workflow and proof-of-concept software application, Geocentric Environment for Analysis and Reasoning (GEAR), which provides a viable transition path to enhance geospatial MCDA in the age of open GIS. We propose a Web-based platform that leverages open-source geotechnologies to incorporate a wide variety of geospatial data formats in a common solution space to allow for spatially enhanced and time-relevant decision analysis. Through the proposed workflow, a user can ingest and modify heterogeneous data formats, exploit temporally tagged data sources, create multicriteria decision analysis models, and visualize the results in an iterative and collaborative workspace. A sample case study applied to disaster relief is used to demonstrate the prototype and workflow. This proof-of-concept Web-based application provides a notional pathway of how to connect open-source data to open-source analysis through a geospatially enabled MCDA workflow that could be virtually accessible to many levels of decision makers from individuals to entire organizations.	10.1080/13658816.2016.1155214	WOS:000374902300010	2016	Web-based geospatial multiple criteria decision analysis using open software and standards
92	Bike sharing can play a role in providing access to transit stations and then to final destinations, but early implementation of these systems in North America has been opportunistic rather than strategic. This study evaluates local intermodal plan goals using trip data and associated infrastructure such as transit stops and bike share station locations in Austin, Texas, and Chicago, Illinois. Bike sharing use data from both cities suggest a weak relationship with existing rail stations that could be strengthened through collaborative, intermodal planning. The study suggests a planning framework and example language that could be tailored to help address the linkage between bike sharing and transit. Rather than an exhaustive study of the practice, this study provides evidence from these two cities that identify opportunities to improve intermodal planning. Cities that are planning or expanding a bike sharing system should consider carefully how to leverage this mode with existing modes of transport. Regardless of a city's status in implementing a bike sharing system, planners can leverage information on existing transport systems for planning at regional and local levels.

93	Scientists often turn to farmers to understand soil management. This process reveals differences and overlaps between local and scientific soil knowledge but rarely considers women and gender issues. This paper examines men's and women's local knowledge of soils in upland, smallholder farms in two villages in Mindanao, the Philippines, using focus group discussions, semi-structured household interviews, field visits, GIS and soil testing. Farmers' field areas were calculated and delineated based on their perceptions of the different types of soils on their land. Men and women chose the same plots for what they considered their best soil but differed on what they felt were their worst. The fertility of the soils that women considered to be the best and worst was not significantly different from that of the men's respective choices. There was a difference in fertility, however, between the best and worst soils regardless of gender. Although soil fertility analyses showed that the women's chosen soils were similar to men's, analyses of qualitative data showed that their knowledge of soils was different and was based in part on a gendered division of labour. A multidisciplinary approach helped bridge the gap between sociocultural and physical research.	10.1111/sjtg.12134	WOS:000368796700002	2016	Gender and local soil knowledge
94	Previous studies have reported multifaceted, controversial social outcomes of densely built urban settings. Social sustainability of urban environments have rarely been studied in a context-sensitive manner, identifying the specific ways urban structural characteristics contribute to the behavioural, experiential and well-being outcomes. In this study, an online public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) methodology allowed the place-based study of urban and suburban contexts in the metropolitan region of Helsinki, Finland. Respondents (N=3119) located their meaningful places and reported the experiential and well-being outcomes. GIS-based measures of urban structures were calculated within a 500m buffer around their homes. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the contextual variation and the mediational role accessibility and perceived environmental quality play in linking urban structural characteristics with well-being outcomes. Our findings indicated that although increasing urban density was associated with shorter distances to everyday services in both urban and suburban settings, the experiential and well-being outcomes varied. In the urban context, easy access to services contributed to higher perceived environmental quality and positive well-being outcomes, whereas in the suburban setting, the closeness of services decreased the experiential and well-being outcomes. Perceived environmental quality was strongly associated with well-being in both contexts. We concluded that densely built urban neighborhoods can also support social sustainability, but the processes vary between suburban and urban settings. A challenge remains for urban planners on how to improve accessibility and related positive experiential outcomes in suburban contexts.	10.1177/0265813515600121	WOS:000368085900003	2016	Urban happiness
95	Coastal areas provide a wealth of resources and represent the most developed spaces worldwide. As pressures on these resources increase, managers and policymakers require understanding that facilitates comprehensive valuation of ecosystem services, including social-ecological dynamics and the coupling of social and natural systems. Adoption of ecosystem management approaches has created a need for increased knowledge of social systems commensurate to baseline ecological understanding; that is, managers benefit from integrating stakeholder values into decision-making processes. This study, using the Delphi technique, elicited knowledge and opinions from international coastal experts regarding relevant social values of ecosystem services, facilitating integration of multiple perspectives into an informed consensus typology of 16 social values. Agencies across the board see inclusive evaluation of ecosystem services, including social values, as critical to robust decision making regarding relevant resources. The next step for research findings is application of the typology in resource assessment initiatives within research and practice-based efforts.	10.1080/08941920.2015.1020580	WOS:000364333800003	2015	A Social Values Typology for Comprehensive Assessment of Coastal Zone Ecosystem Services
96	The neighborhood context affects social capital, yet scholars do not adequately account for the dynamic nature of the social spaces people occupy in measuring social capital. Research has focused on neighborhood effects as though the neighborhood space is fixed across all inhabitants without regard for the ways individuals define their neighborhoods considering their own spatial location and social interactions. Using a neighborhood-level social capital measure, we examine the relationship between cognitive neighborhood boundaries and social capital in residents (N = 135) of two public housing communities in a Southern urban city. As collective efficacy (bonding social capital) increased so too did the predicted size of one's cognitive neighborhood. GIS maps demonstrated that participant boundaries included areas of commerce and services necessary to build and maintain social capital. Larger cognitive neighborhoods suggest one may interact with a wider array of people to achieve instrumental and expressive returns despite the high-poverty neighborhood context.	10.1111/cico.12133	WOS:000366974100006	2015	Spatial Dimensions of Social Capital
97	Prior research has examined the relationship between physical landscapes and ecosystem services, but the distribution of ecosystem services by land tenure and protected areas is less developed. We analyze the spatial distribution of participatory mapped ecosystem values, as indicators of ecosystem services, to determine their relationship with land tenure in southern Norway, a region characterized by private, village, and state commons lands overlaid with designated protected areas managed by local governments. We found land tenure to be a significantly stronger predictor of the distribution of ecosystem values and land use preferences than protected area status. Protected area designations layered on older land tenures exert relatively little influence on how Norwegians perceive ecosystem values and land use preferences. The exception is a few iconic parks located on state commons where participants mapped a higher proportion of biological diversity and undisturbed, natural qualities. Hunting and fishing opportunities were especially important in village commons, whereas social interactions, gathering, and cultural identity clustered near settlements on private lands. The cultural ecosystem values of recreation and scenery were most frequently identified, but were unrelated to both land tenure and protected areas. Cabins, tourism development, and snowmobile use were important land uses to regional residents and most controversial in the commons and protected areas, but the overall potential for land use conflict appears highest on private land. Participants mapped preferences to increase predator control across all tenures reflecting the strong interest in large game hunting and livestock grazing in the region. Overlapping tenures that were in place before the designation of protected areas are important for understanding conservation effectiveness and the potential for land use conflict.

98	Geographers of technology illustrate software code's contexts, effects, and agencies as they shape urban space and everyday life, but the consequences of code for nature remain understudied. Political ecologists have critiqued remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based conservation projects, but have not engaged more broadly with the role of software in the contested production, circulation, and application of ecological knowledge. Yet, around the world, data analytics firms and conservation nonprofits argue for optimizing environmental management through faster and bigger data collection and new techniques of data manipulation and visualization. I present a case study from the US state of Oregon, illustrating how conservationists and environmental regulators employ computer programming to plan markets in which entrepreneurs restore stream and wetland ecosystem services to earn offset credits. In these markets, code-executed algorithms constituting spreadsheets, web maps, and GIS utilities generate, relate, and make sense of the data that define credit commodities. I argue that code tends toward three effects: producing a landscape defined by wetlands' modeled value, performing social relations associated with nature's neoliberalization and financialization, and legitimating these moves. Although emphasis on the performativity of code and other technological objects is warranted, the contexts in which these are authored, deployed, and evaluated should remain central to understanding environmental governance. This is to caution against seeing technology as reducing nature and society to state or capitalist rationalities and to hesitate to differentiate prima facie code's work on space and on nature. I call for bridging political ecology and geographies of technology in ways that can explain how code is generative of environmental knowledge, change, and conflict.	10.1177/0308518X15616631	WOS:000366667200011	2015	Performing nature's value
99	Assuring equal accessibility to public outdoor and recreation services is important because of the potential health and social welfare implications. The focus has primarily been on parks and other green spaces but should be expanded to include also the aquatic environments and the numerous recreational opportunities they have to offer. As the accessibility standards and approaches on ensuring equal accessibility to green spaces are often based on purely spatial measurements, this research examined the equality of accessibility of aquatic environments by combining spatio-temporal dimensions of accessibility with person-based measures. Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) method used in the study provided multifaceted knowledge on the person-based accessibility patterns related to aquatic environments in Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. This paper demonstrates how an advanced GIS-based analysis combining both objective and subjective measurements of accessibility can result in more detailed and even contradictory outcomes compared to traditional spatial measures. The results indicate that a common presumption of a nearest service available made in studies on accessibility and environmental justice may have notable impacts on results or even return unfounded interpretations. Results also indicate that there are significant (p < 0.05) differences in accessibility in the study region related to income status and car ownership. We conclude that PPGIS approaches can provide valuable information to accessibility research, studies on environmental justice and provide additional approaches for the planning and management officials of public recreation and outdoor services.

100	The neighbourhood environment may enable active aging by allowing the integration of walking into an older adult's daily routine. This study explores the relationship between the neighbourhood built environment and walking among a small group of older adults in a large suburban municipality in Canada. In-depth interviews using a photo-voice approach revealed that the participants walked largely to accumulated physical activity. Older adults who lived in either conventional residential or condominium neighbourhoods discussed poor traffic conditions and lack of benches/trees/places as barriers, and proximity to parks and access to shops as enablers to walking. Poor sidewalk quality, absence of street lights and personal safety concerns were major barriers to walking only for those living in suburban residential neighbourhoods. Our results indicate that high quality- and safe walking infrastructure may facilitate walking for physical activity among older adults living in the suburban communities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

101	This paper builds on the designation of networked spatial information technologies (both hardware/software objects and information artifacts) as spatial media' to advance media as an epistemology for engaging these presences as both channels for content and as cultural apparatuses. Doing so directly asserts their materiality as coincident with (new) media techno-cultural productions. This allows for a theory of mediation that belies narratives of virtual'-real' spatial hybrids by instead understanding spatiality (as the nexus of material socio-spatio-technical relations) as always-already mediated - i.e. as the ontogenetic effects of the contingent, necessarily incomplete comings-together of technical presences, persons, and space/place.	10.1177/0309132514558443	WOS:000364737600003	2015	Spatial media/tion
102	Spatially-explicit participatory planning is a relatively new approach for managing visitors to protected areas. In this study we used public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) mapping and global positioning system (GPS) tracking to monitor mountain bikers frequenting national parks for tourism and recreation in Northern Sydney, Australia. PPGIS was implemented using both an internet application and with hardcopy maps in the field. Our research addressed two fundamental questions for park planning: (1) What is the spatial distribution of visitor activities and location-specific reasons for riding; and (2) What location-specific actions are needed to improve riding experiences? The spatial distributions of riding activities generated in PPGIS showed strong correlation with the GPS tracking results, with riding locations being related to the reasons for track selection. Riders proposed a broad range of management actions to improve riding experiences. PPGIS mapping provides a cost-effective approach to facilitate spatial decision making, allowing park agencies to prioritise future visitor management actions. We discuss the strengths and limitations of these research methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

103	Community is an ambiguous concept, and the meanings of community as a subject of study have received a great deal of attention across various disciplines. This paper discusses how children's diverse meanings of community shape and are shaped by the social, cultural, and physical environments of their everyday lives. To explore these meanings I combine principles of child-centered research and qualitative geovisualization into a research methodology. I demonstrate that this integration displays the transformative nature of qualitative analysis and visualization to support interpretive analysis of various forms of qualitative and spatial data together, and offers us a hybrid methodological framework for gaining insights into the diverse meanings of community held by the children. The main case study is drawn from a multi-year research collaboration called the Children's Urban Geography (ChUG), in which I participated along with children who lived in a relatively poor but emerging multi-cultural Hispanic neighborhood in Buffalo, NY.	10.1080/14733285.2014.964666	WOS:000363690200007	2015	Community through the eyes of children
104	Protected areas provide important ecosystem services globally but few studies have examined how cultural differences influence the distribution of cultural ecosystem values and management preferences. We used internet-based public participation GIS (PPGIS) in the countries of Norway and Poland to identify ecosystem values and management preferences in protected areas held by regional residents and site users. We found significant differences in the type and quantity of ecosystem values with Norwegians mapping more values relating to use of resources (e.g., hunting/fishing, gathering) and Polish respondents mapping more environmental values such as scenery, biological diversity, and water quality. With respect to management preferences, Norwegians identified more preferences for resource utilization while Polish respondents identified more preferences for conservation. Norwegian respondents were more satisfied with protected area management and local participation which can be explained by historical, legal, and cultural differences between the two countries. For Norway, biodiversity conservation in protected areas will continue to be guided by sustainable use of protected areas, rather than strict nature protection, with management favoring local board control and active public participation. For Poland, change in protected area management to enhance biodiversity conservation is less certain, driven by national environmental values that conflict with local values and preferences, continuing distrust in government, and low levels of civic participation. Differential efficacy in PPGIS methods Norway with greater participation from household sampling and Poland with greater response using social media suggest different strategies will be required for effective public engagement in protected area planning and management.

105	The island of Nantucket has, in the last fifty years, undergone great social and environmental changes. Using geographic information systems (GIS) and building on principles of grounded visualizationthe visualization of qualitative data to detect trends and patternsand mixed methods research, we employ a cartographic construct of oral histories to investigate how changes were perceived on the island. We found that respondents concentrated largely on economic factors rather than abstract concepts when articulating change and interpreted historical events, even relatively distant ones, employing a narrative of the island's past that was largely a construction of a small elite of visionaries. ????????????,???????????????????????(GIS),?????????????????????????????????????,???????????,???????????????,?????????????????,??????,???????,?????????????,????????????????????????????

106	The identification of spatial associations between perceived ecosystem values and physical landscapes is confronted by a diversity of mapping methods, heterogeneous human populations, and variability in physical landscape classification systems. This study reviews previous research on spatial associations and reports new empirical findings from Norway to describe the potential for spatial \\value transfer\\" methods that extrapolate ecosystem values to other locations. Public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey methods were implemented in two separate study areas in Norway to identify ecosystem values and to analyze their spatial association with land cover data. The ecosystem value associations with land cover were generally consistent with global findings reported elsewhere, with forested areas providing multiple ecosystem \\"bundles\\" supporting both recreation-related and provisioning values. Alternative value transfer methods were demonstrated using recreation value to compare actual with predicted distributions using land cover indices derived from value proportions, deviations from expected distribution, and correlation coefficients with ecosystem value bundles. The use of simple ecosystem value percentages located within land cover classes provided the best predictive results for value transfer in this study. The limitations and potential for value transfer methods based on spatial associations between mapped ecosystem values and physical landscape characteristics are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

107	Our wellbeing depends upon the services provided by ecosystems and their components. Despite recent advances in academic understanding of ecosystem services, and consideration in UK national environmental policy, a greater awareness is needed at community and individual levels. Dynamic features of virtual globe applications have considerable potential for helping convey the multi-dimensional context of ecosystem services and promoting general awareness. In a case study targeting residents in a small urban fringe river catchment in Norfolk, UK, representatives from local authorities and responsible agencies collaborated with scientists to produce extensive customisation of virtual globes in this context. By implementing a virtual flight over the catchment, different views and scales are traversed to set the context for landscape features and ecosystem services. Characteristic sites, e.g. supplying cultural services, are displayed and relationships with the natural environment are explained using linked on-screen text. Implementation is cost-effective and described for practitioners in ecosystem and landscape management, who may be inexperienced in landscape visualisation. Supplied as three pre-packaged virtual tours, products are made available for download and are publicised at a variety of engagement events, including teaching events with schoolchildren. The tours have attracted public interest and generated positive feedback about improving knowledge of local natural assets. Schoolchildren show confidence with the interface, but supplementary problem based activities can improve learning opportunities. The capacity of virtual globes to support more participatory involvement of the public in local ecosystem management may increase in the future, but such visualisations can already help promote community awareness of local landscape benefits.

108	Sophisticated geospatial modeling of environmental problems and hazards is far advanced in geography, decision science, and related fields. The political ecological application of these tools, especially in visualizing, debating, and contesting risk, is underdeveloped, however. By using visualizations of risk as an analytical tool to explore the views of citizens and county health officials, geospatial models can help to explore the schisms, connections, and associations among complex landscapes, diverse publics, and logics of governance. In this paper, we explore the case of West Nile virus in the Southwest United States, a site where county health departments, vector control districts, and urban residents practice varying methods of mosquito management. We created geospatial visualizations of mosquito microhabitat using a dynamic simulation model and remotely sensed imagery. These data, when differentially aggregated, produced divergent visualizations of mosquito risk spaces across the city of Tucson. Presenting maps to neighborhood residents and local health officials, we found they invited different understandings of spatialized areas of responsibility for mosquito management. Neighborhood focus groups expressed territorial notions of risk and responsibility that diverged widely from those of health officials. Visualizations were shown to both reflect and produce different mosquito narratives, showing how mapped models can help elicit political-ecological insight into the territorialization of mosquito control.

292	This paper reviews research which has investigated community skills for carbon (and other natural resource) monitoring. The assessment focuses on the reliability of the data, the cost of community monitoring (CM) versus expert surveys, and the broader benefits and challenges of involving communities in the process. We identify the tasks considered necessary for carbon monitoring inventories. The review finds that CM is useful and cost-effective for REDD+ carbon monitoring. In particular, forest inventories communities can provide forest enhancement data unobtainable by other means at the scale required. CM is particularly helpful in assessing rates of forest degradation, and would density a national forest inventory in community management areas. We conclude that communities can assess above ground biomass, monitor social and environmental variables, and store and transmit the data.	10.1016/j.cosust.2012.10.008	WOS:000312418600016	2012	The role of community carbon monitoring for REDD+

109	In recent years, we have seen the emergence of sound mapping, through which users can share their recordings of sounds via online mapping platforms. These practices are enabled by an array of spatial and digital technologies that also facilitate the growth of the so-called volunteered geographic information (VGI) regarding contributions from users without training in conventional GIS or cartography. In the growing body of work on VGI, however, not much attention has been given to the emergence of such sound maps as part of the VGI constructions. Meanwhile, research in soundscape has not addressed the aspect of crowd-sourcing or user-generated contributions facilitated by new information and communication technologies. This article seeks to bridge this gap. It draws upon important insights from critical GIS research into investigating VGI as visual practices, while it is also informed by three areas of soundscape research including mapping soundscapes, tracing the production of soundscapes and exploring embodied experiences with soundscapes. Through an empirical case in China, this article suggests a two-level analytical framework: investigating in what ways crowd-sourced sound maps emerge and interpreting these sounds on their shared platforms. In so doing, this study calls for more engagement with the multi-modality aspect of visuality in mappings, which in turn may have implications for landscape design and planning. In this way, it seeks to enrich the discussion on critical visualization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

110	Big data is increasingly seen as a way of providing a more 'scientific' approach to the understanding and management of cities. But most geographic analyses of geotagged social media data have failed to mobilize a sufficiently complex understanding of socio-spatial relations. By combining the conceptual approach of relational socio-spatial theory with the methods of critical GIScience, this paper explores the spatial imaginaries and processes of segregation and mobility at play in the notion of the '9th Street Divide' in Louisville, Kentucky. Through a more context-sensitive analysis of this data, this paper argues against this popular spatial imaginary and the notion that the Louisville's West End is somehow separate and apart from the rest of the city. By analyzing the everyday activity spaces of different groups of Louisvillians through geotagged Twitter data, we instead argue for an understanding of these neighborhoods as fluid, porous and actively produced, rather than as rigid, static or fixed. Ultimately, this paper is meant to provide a conceptual and methodological framework for the analysis of social media data that is more attentive to the multiplicity of socio-spatial relations embodied in such data.

111	This article reviews the state of \\critical cartography\\" which is being experimented with exuberance in a number of disciplines and arenas: geographers, community development activists, artists, and new media innovators, to name a few. The promise and possibilities of debunking and retooling cartography are significant: by opening up who can make a map and the kinds of maps that are made, overlooked phenomena can be reclaimed, different perspectives can be made apparent, and new knowledge constructed. However, the conditions under which the emancipatory potential of critical cartography might be realized need to be investigated. This article critiques the claims that current new mapping practices increase participation and democracy and outlines four issues critical cartography needs to further develop in order to increase its potential: 1) greater reflexivity on the critical cartographer's own position and influence of the project, 2) acknowledgement of the choices made of what not to include in the map, 3) greater consideration about the politics of aesthetics, 4) expanded search for deeper social engagement with new mapping projects. The article also discusses these issues through a case study map project of street vendors contesting the use of sidewalk space in Ho Chi Minh City. It explores the qualities a non-participatory, authored map project might engender critical visualization through processes of spatial ethnography. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

112	In recent years, geospatial design (or geodesign) has emerged as an area of technological development, GIScience research, and design practice. With Esri leading the branding of this emerging area, geospatial technology developers, design consultancies, and academic units are recognizing the affordances of applying geovisualization and geoanalytical techniques to more conventional practices within design and planning fields. Additionally, the GISciences are being called to rearticulate their research agendas in the face of 'big data' and neogeography. This paper examines these developments with regard to criticality, or the ways in which mapping practices are applied in critical research - both research that seeks to situate the emergence of geospatial technologies and enrolls these technologies more directly as method. What is the criticality of mapping practices amid these developments? More specifically to the design and planning fields, how might geodesign align with critical GIS? I take up these questions by tracing three presuppositions of criticality in mapping while examining the conditions of geodesign's emergence: representation and futurity, neutrality and efficacy, and relationality and complexity. I conclude by outlining a research agenda for further advancement of a critical geodesign. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

114	The Florida Keys is recognized as the birth place of flats fishing, but the flats fishery has historically been underappreciated by resource managers because it is a catch and release fishery. However, the fishery is increasingly threatened by habitat degradation and user conflicts. Ongoing regulatory revisions in the Florida Keys prompted us to work with flats fishing guides to document spatial fishing coverage and habitats so that this information could be included in management revisions. We used a geostatistical approach to create contour maps depicting fishing coverage and habitats, and provided this information to resource managers. This participatory GIS approach engages stakeholders in the management process, uses their knowledge of the resource, and contributes to resource and fisheries conservation. This study, in combination with research on the economic impact of the flats fishery, presents the flats fishery as an important conservation tool for the region and underscores the implication of relationships between researchers and data providers in the saltwater recreational fishery.	10.1007/s10641-015-0435-z	WOS:000362665500008	2015	Mapping of stakeholder activities and habitats to inform conservation planning for a national marine sanctuary
115	Situated at the intersection of the arts and sciences, Humanities GIS (HumGIS) are contributing to new knowledge systems emerging in the digital, spatial, and geo-humanities. This article discusses the conceptualization and operationalization of two HumGIS models engaging the cartographical and discursive tools employed by James Joyce to compose Ulysses ([1922] 1992). The first model is used to perform a visual geo-literary historical analysis by transposing Homeric and Dantean topologies on a spatialized narrative of Joyce's work. The second model integrates Ulysses within a social media map to interpret Bloomsday 2014 digital ecosystem spatial performances in Dublin and globally. This article suggests that HumGIS models reflecting human contingency, idiosyncrasy, and affect, drawing on literary, historical, and social media tools, sources, and perceptions, might offer GIScience, neogeography, and big data studies alternative spatial framings and modeling scenarios. Ubicados en la interseccion de las artes y las ciencias, los SIG Humanidades (HumSIG) estan contribuyendo en los sistemas de nuevo conocimiento que surgen en las humanidades digitales, espaciales y geograficas. En este articulo se discuten la conceptualizacion y operacionalizacion de dos modelos HumSIG que involucran las herramientas cartograficas y discursivas empleadas por James Joyce para armar el Ulises ([1922]1992). El primero de estos modelos se usa para representar un analisis historico geoliterario de caracter visual, transponiendo topologias homericas y dantescas a una narrativa espacializada del trabajo de Joyce. El segundo modelo integra a Ulises dentro de un mapa de medios sociales para interpretar las representaciones espaciales del ecosistema digital Bloomsday de 2014 en Dublin y globalmente. Este articulo sugiere que los modelos HumSIG, al reflejar la contingencia humana, la idiosincrasia y el afecto, con el apoyo de herramientas, fuentes y percepciones literarias, historicas y de los medios sociales, podrian ofrecer a los estudios de SIGciencia, neogeografia y big data una alternativa de marcos espaciales y escenarios de modelado.	10.1080/00045608.2015.1054252	WOS:000361205000004	2015	Visual Geo-Literary and Historical Analysis, Tweetflickrtubing, and James Joyce's Ulysses (1922)
116	In this paper, we argue that place mapping is useful for approaching children's conception of place and that this is of relevance when designing physical activity interventions. We contend that socio-material factors influence children's perception and use of places, and are crucial to understand in relation to their use of local neighbourhoods for physical activity. A place mapping of children's understandings and everyday use of their local neighbourhood in suburban Copenhagen was conducted with a fifth grade elementary school class. The mapping and subsequent analysis resulted in three categories of relevance to children's conceptions of place; located social experiences, experiences of the unknown, and children's contested spaces. We argue that such knowledge can provide useful information in the development and evaluation of activities that promote physical activity in urban spaces.	10.1080/14733285.2014.927052	WOS:000359704900006	2015	Conceptions of place
117	It is increasingly recognized that ecosystems provide varied services that should be considered in land management decisions. One of the challenges in the valuation of landscapes is that they often provide multiple services that combine into one social-ecological system. In this article we show how overlaps of those services can be measured, visualized, and explained. The results from a case study conducted in a rural community in northern Namibia show that in some landscapes, services are intertwined. We draw on a practice approach and ethnographic data to explain this finding and argue that services are related within places and fields of action. More specifically, we show that material services such as the provision of food and income form a unified whole with nonmaterial or cultural services such as beauty and social interaction and are often experienced simultaneously.Research for this article is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and is part of The Future Okavango (TFO) project on anthropogenic influences and cultural dimensions of environmental uses in the Okavango catchment (www.future-okavango.org).This is an Open Access article.

118	Investigative analysts gather data from different sources, especially from social media (SM), in order to shed light on cognitive factors that may explain criminal spatial behavior. A former research shows how tweets can be used to estimate private points of interest. Authors' aim was to demonstrate, as they extend the analysis to a wider statistical base, how social maps and Web applications could be used in investigative analysis and spatial cognition research. A total of 100 Twitter accounts with approximately 250 tweets each were submitted to common geographical techniques (measures such as Convex-Hull, Mean-Center, Median-Center, Standard-Deviation-Ellipse) in order to test the hypothesis that user areas of activity are predictable. Predictions were tested through a set of specific information: clear reference to areas of activity and clear reference about user's residence. Simple algorithms and procedures demonstrated that they could be used to predict where SM users live, giving positive results in about 4/5 cases and giving indications about their home location. In fact, all home positions were found in the Convex-Hull and most of them in the Standard-Deviation-Ellipse. Furthermore, in up to 80 % of cases, houses were found within a buffer zone of 1.500 m with Median-Center as centrum (70 % using Median-Center as centrum) with a minimum effectiveness threshold of 12-13 tweets. SM may help in studying people mobility and their cognition of space and, moreover, where they live, or their traveling behavior. The processing of geographical data in conjunction with the SM analysis may facilitate the construction of models describing specific behavior of people. The use of geographical information system tools and SM analysis represents an effective approach in order to acquire spatial and territorial information, referred to social relationship. The results may be used successfully in the understanding of social dynamics and for the prevention of criminal behavior.	10.1007/s10339-015-0711-z	WOS:000368472000322	2015	Socio-Spatial Intelligence
119	Area restrictions prohibiting people from entering drug scenes or areas where they were arrested are a common socio-legal mechanism employed to regulate the spatial practices of people who use drugs (PWUD). To explore how socio-spatial patterns stemming from area restrictions shape risk, harm, and health care access, qualitative interviews and mapping exercises were conducted with 24 PWUD with area restrictions in Vancouver, Canada. Area restrictions disrupted access to health and social resources (e.g., HIV care) concentrated in drug scenes, while territorial stigma prevented PWUD from accessing supports in other neighborhoods. Rather than preventing involvement in drug-related activities, area restrictions displaced these activities to other locations and increased vulnerability to diverse risks and harms (e.g., unsafe drug use practices, violence). Given the harms stemming from area restrictions there is an urgent need to reconsider this socio-legal strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

120	Background: As part of the Charleston Area Pollution Prevention Partnership (CAPs), studies have been performed to address environmental health issues using various techniques including Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping. Most of the mapping has been conducted by academic team members; however, there is a need for more community-based mapping to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of community-driven efforts to eliminate environmental hazards and health disparities. The emergence of public participatory GIS (PPGIS) has been shown as a way to democratize science, build community capacity, and empower local citizens to address environmental health issues. Purpose: This article describes the development of the Environmental Justice (EJ) Radar, a PPGIS tool that provides stakeholders in South Carolina with a way to raise environmental awareness and improve citizen participation in local environmental decision-making. We describe the functionality of EJ Radar and discuss feedback received from stakeholders to improve the utility of the PPGIS tool.	NA	WOS:000364798100016	2015	Environmental Justice Radar
121	Background Childhood obesity has been rising rapidly in the USA. The rate is higher among those at a lower socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minority groups. In Alabama, nearly half of the children from rural African American families are overweight or obese. Studies suggest that children's eating behaviours and weight could be influenced by surrounding food environments. The purpose of this paper is to assess the community food environment and examine the associations with childhood obesity in Alabama's Black Belt region. Methods This research uses both qualitative and quantitative methods. Weight status of 613 African American students in four elementary schools in a rural county of Alabama was assessed. We examined community food environments around children's home through GIS (Geographic Information System) and statistical methods. The interrelations between children's weight and community food environments are explored with multi-level models. Results Approximately 42.1% of surveyed children were overweight or obese, much higher than the national average, 30.6%. In Model 1, convenience stores (3.44; P < 0.01), full service restaurants (8.99; P < 0.01) and supermarkets (-37.69; P < 0.01) were significantly associated with the percentile of body mass index. Fast food stores (-0.93; P = 0.88) were not related to children's weight. In Model 2, the additions of sociodemographic factors and school effects cause significant changes of the relationships between children's weight and four types of food outlets. The percentage of African American population (90.23, P < 0.01) and school (6.68, P < 0.01) were positively associated with children's weight; while median household income (-39.6; P < 0.01) was negatively related to it. Conclusion Children's weight is influenced by community food environments, sociodemographic factors and school context. Findings suggest that policymakers and planners need to improve community food environments of low-income minority communities. Parents and schools should pay more attention to reduce the negative impacts of food environments on children.	10.1111/cch.12204	WOS:000362193200003	2015	Childhood obesity and community food environments in Alabama's Black Belt region
122	Understanding the relationship between humans and their environment is essential for the planning and management of social-ecological systems but integration of social values with biophysical landscape information remains challenging. Identifying areas that are likely to be pivotal in land use planning decisions from both social and ecological perspectives provides one means of integration. Social-ecological \\hotspots\\" represent valuable areas from both human and environmental perspectives but appropriate and valid methods for identifying such areas are under-developed. We applied an inductive research approach using empirical spatial data from a regional study in Australia to evaluate alternative methods for identifying social-ecological hotspots. Social data measuring the importance of the landscape was collected using public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) while ecologically valuable areas were identified from species distributions and Zonation conservation prioritization software. We applied multiple importance thresholds (cut-offs) to separately identify and measure social and ecological hotspots, and then quantified the degree of spatial concurrence (overlap) when combining the layers to generate social-ecological hotspots. Based on the findings, we developed guidelines for identifying social-ecological hotspots under variable data conditions. We describe the practical implications of our findings by showing how the selected method for SES hotspot identification can enhance or limit the utility of hotspot analysis for decision support in regional conservation planning.

123	Asthma is complex and connected to a number of factors including access to healthcare, crime and violence, and environmental triggers. A mixed method approach was used to examine the experiences of urban people with asthma in controlling their asthma symptoms. The study started with an initial phase of qualitative interviews in West Philadelphia, a primarily poor African American community. Data from qualitative, semi-structured interviews indicated that stress, environmental irritants, and environmental allergens were the most salient triggers of asthma. Based on the interviews, the team identified six neighborhood factors to map including crime, housing vacancy, illegal dumping, tree canopy and parks. These map layers were combined into a final composite map. These combined methodologies contextualized respondents' perceptions in the framework of the actual community and built environment which tells a more complete story about their experience with asthma.

124	Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is increasingly used to assess land use plans in a way that is broader in spatial, temporal and conceptual scope than traditional Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Meanwhile, conservation scientists have recognised that successful biodiversity conservation outcomes rely on information about both biological priorities and the feasibility of undertaking conservation actions. SEA provides a framework for integrating information on the social determinants of conservation feasibility with supporting environmental legislation in order to achieve enhanced conservation outcomes. In this paper we argue that data on the social context of land use plans are vital to ensure effective biodiversity conservation outcomes that result from SEAs. We explore the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) (EPBC Act) as a case example of how the integration of these data can be practically achieved within an existing legal process. While a range of social data is relevant to this type of assessment, we focus on the use of spatially-referenced social data in the context of land use planning. When applied to the design and implementation of land use plans, this type of information can improve the acceptability of conservation actions, enhance environmental stewardship, and minimise land use conflict through taking stock of the values and attitudes (precursors to behaviour) that are relevant to proposed land use change and conservation action. Through exploring the integration of these data into each of the stages of SEA under the EPBC Act, we show that opportunities exist to strengthen the effectiveness of SEA in delivering conservation outcomes without altering existing legal processes. Yet, for this to be done effectively, practitioners need to be cognisant of a range of theoretical and methodological challenges related to the generation and interpretation of these data, as well as the socio-political context in which they are applied.

125	The value of mixed-methods research has recently re-gained impetus among geographers interested in the production of knowledge (Elwood, 2010). Key conversations have centred on efforts to blend traditionally viewed quantitative tools such as GIS with more qualitative practices and data. While discussions in qualitative GIS have demonstrated the value of merging the qualitative in GIS, we highlight the unexplored potential of GIS in the enactment of qualitative research, specifically as visual method. Our argument is based on research which explored the role of the state in urban change in Dublin City. We conclude that there is significant potential to better incorporate GIS into visual methods, particularly through photo-elicitation style interviews. Contrary to some of the existing literature, the persuasive power of the map as visual resource can prove particularly successful in engaging elite stakeholders. Further, we conclude that the methodological approach we took, facilitated the production of different kinds of knowledge around processes of urban governance.	10.1177/0042098014545520	WOS:000359088900005	2015	Investigating urban transformations
126	The marine environment provides significant benefits to many local communities. Pressure to develop coastal waterways worldwide creates an urgent need for tools to locate marine spaces that have important social or ecological values, and to quantify their relative importance. The primary objective of this study was to develop, apply and critically assess a tool to identify important social-ecological hotspots in the marine environment. The study was conducted in a typical coastal community in northern British Columbia, Canada. This expert-informed GIS, or xGIS, tool used a survey instrument to draw on the knowledge of local experts from a range of backgrounds with respect to a series of 12 social-ecological value attributes, such as biodiversity, cultural and economic values. We identified approximately 1500 polygons on marine maps and assigned relative values to them using a token distribution exercise. A series of spatial statistical analyses were performed to locate and quantify the relative social-ecological importance of marine spaces and the results were ultimately summarized in a single hotspot map of the entire study area. This study demonstrates the utility of xGIS as a useful tool for stakeholders and environmental managers engaged in the planning and management of marine resources at the local and regional levels.

128	There is increasing recognition of the importance for local biodiversity of post-mining sites, many of which lie near communities that have suffered significant social and economic deprivation as the result of mine closures. However, no studies to date have actively used the knowledge of local communities to relate the history and treatment of post-mining sites to their current ecological status. We report a study of two post-mining sites in the Yorkshire coalfield of the UK in which the local community were involved in developing site histories and assessing plant and invertebrate species composition. Site histories developed using participatory GIS revealed that the sites had a mixture of areas of spontaneous succession and technical reclamation, and identified that both planned management interventions and informal activities influenced habitat heterogeneity and ecological diversity. Two groups of informal activity were identified as being of particular importance. Firstly, there has been active protection by the community of flower-rich habitats of conservation value (e.g. calcareous grassland) and distinctive plant species (e.g. orchids) which has also provided important foraging resources for butterfly and bumblebee species. Secondly, disturbance by activities such as use of motorbikes, informal camping, and cutting of trees and shrubs for fuel, as well as planned management interventions such as spreading of brick rubble, has provided habitat for plant species of open waste ground and locally uncommon invertebrate species which require patches of bare ground. This study demonstrates the importance of informal, and often unrecorded, activities by the local community in providing diverse habitats and increased biodiversity within a post-mining site, and shows that active engagement with the local community and use of local knowledge can enhance ecological interpretation of such sites and provide a stronger basis for successful future management.	10.1371/journal.pone.0136522	WOS:000360069400133	2015	Exploring the Links between Post-Industrial Landscape History and Ecology through Participatory Methods
129	Future climate in the Nordic countries is expected to become warmer, wetter, and wilder', and this will probably cause more extreme weather events. Therefore, local authorities need to improve their ability to assess weather-related hazards such as floods, landslides, and storms, as well as people's sensitivity and capacity to cope with or adjust to such events. In this article, we present an integrated assessment of vulnerability to natural hazards, which incorporates both exposure and social vulnerability. In our assessment, we screen places and rank them by their relative scores on exposure and vulnerability indices. We also design a web-based visualization tool - ViewExposed - that shows maps that reveal a considerable geographic variation in integrated vulnerability. ViewExposed makes it easy to identify the places with the highest integrated vulnerability, and it facilitates the understanding of the factors that make these places exposed and/or vulnerable. For empirical validation, we correlate the exposure indices with insurance claims due to natural damage. However, we also emphasize the importance of a dialog with relevant stakeholders to ensure a participatory validation. Our top-down exposure and vulnerability assessment benefits from a participatory bottom-up assessment. This is crucial to support decisions about where to implement adaptive and preventive measures against hazards related to climate change.	10.1080/13669877.2014.923027	WOS:000359792400006	2015	Three core activities toward a relevant integrated vulnerability assessment
130	Many users of online interactive maps have substantial problems interacting with these maps. The main goal of this paper is to explore the issues related to the interaction with GIS-based interactive online maps. An example is taken from a Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) created for the inhabitants in Wilhelmsburg, a city district of Hamburg, Germany. The application was developed within a European project and tested in two phases: first with the inhabitants of Wilhelmsburg and second with a group of students of urban planning with some basic GIS skills. In this article, we present the results of testing with both groups and discuss open research and practical issues related to the interaction with online interactive maps. We conclude the article with a list of relevant research topics which address this interaction and the consequences the design of online maps can have on the ability of the user to use them efficiently.	10.1080/15230406.2014.991427	WOS:000359725800007	2015	How user-friendly are online interactive maps?
131	Background: A call has recently been made by the public health and medical communities to understand the neighborhood context of a patient's life in order to improve education and treatment. To do this, methods are required that can collect \\contextual\\" characteristics while complementing the spatial analysis of more traditional data. This also needs to happen within a standardized, transferable, easy-to-implement framework. Methods: The Spatial Video Geonarrative (SVG) is an environmentally-cued narrative where place is used to stimulate discussion about fine-scale geographic characteristics of an area and the context of their occurrence. It is a simple yet powerful approach to enable collection and spatial analysis of expert and resident health-related perceptions and experiences of places. Participants comment about where they live or work while guiding a driver through the area. Four GPS-enabled cameras are attached to the vehicle to capture the places that are observed and discussed by the participant. Audio recording of this narrative is linked to the video via time stamp. A program (G-Code) is then used to geotag each word as a point in a geographic information system (GIS). Querying and density analysis can then be performed on the narrative text to identify spatial patterns within one narrative or across multiple narratives. This approach is illustrated using case studies on post-disaster psychopathology, crime, mosquito control, and TB in homeless populations. Results: SVG can be used to map individual, group, or contested group context for an environment. The method can also gather data for cohorts where traditional spatial data are absent. In addition, SVG provides a means to spatially capture, map and archive institutional knowledge. Conclusions: SVG GIS output can be used to advance theory by being used as input into qualitative and/or spatial analyses. SVG can also be used to gain near-real time insight therefore supporting applied interventions. Advances over existing geonarrative approaches include the simultaneous collection of video data to visually support any commentary, and the ease-of-application making it a transferable method across different environments and skillsets."	10.1186/s12942-015-0014-8	WOS:000359111000001	2015	Spatial video geonarratives and health
132	Spatial technologies and the organizations around them, such as the Standby Task Force and Ushahidi, are increasingly changing the ways crises and emergencies are addressed. Within digital humanitarianism, Big Data has featured strongly in recent efforts to improve digital humanitarian work. This shift toward social media and other Big Data sources has entailed unexamined assumptions about technological progress, social change, and the kinds of knowledge captured by data. These assumptions stand in tension with critical geographic scholarship, and in particular critical GIS research. In this paper I borrow from critical research on technologies to engage three important new facets of Big Data emerging from an interrogation of digital humanitarianism. I argue first that within digital humanitarianism, Big Data should be understood as a new set of practices, in addition to its usual conception as data and analytics technologies. Second, I argue that Big Data constitutes a distinct epistemology that obscures many forms of knowledge in crises and emergencies and produces a limited understanding of how a crisis is unfolding. Third, I argue that Big Data is constitutive of a social relation in which both the formal humanitarian sector and \\victims'' of crises are in need of the services and labor that can be provided by digital humanitarians."	10.1007/s10708-014-9599-x	WOS:000367616600004	2015	Rethinking big data in digital humanitarianism
133	Background: Access to health services such as palliative care is determined not only by health policy but a number of legacies linked to geography and settlement patterns. We use GIS to calculate potential spatio-temporal access to palliative care services. In addition, we combine qualitative data with spatial analysis to develop a unique mixed-methods approach. Methods: Inpatient health care facilities with dedicated palliative care beds were sampled in two Canadian provinces: Newfoundland and Saskatchewan. We then calculated one-hour travel time catchments to palliative health services and extended the spatial model to integrate available beds as well as documented wait times. Results: 26 facilities with dedicated palliative care beds in Newfoundland and 69 in Saskatchewan were identified. Spatial analysis of one-hour travel times and palliative beds per 100,000 population in each province showed distinctly different geographical patterns. In Saskatchewan, 96.7 % of the population living within a-1 h of drive to a designated palliative care bed. In Newfoundland, 93.2 % of the population aged 65+ were living within a-1 h of drive to a designated palliative care bed. However, when the relationship between wait time and bed availability was examined for each facility within these two provinces, the relationship was found to be weak in Newfoundland (R-2 = 0.26) and virtually nonexistent in Saskatchewan (R-2 = 0.01). Conclusions: Our spatial analysis shows that when wait times are incorporated as a way to understand potential spatio-temporal access to dedicated palliative care beds, as opposed to spatial access alone, the picture of access changes.	10.1186/s12913-015-0909-x	WOS:000357978700004	2015	A comparative analysis of potential spatio-temporal access to palliative care services in two Canadian provinces
134	More effective collaboration is a recurring theme to improve public participation in planning. But collaborative processes are constrained by the number of people that can participate, limiting the diversity and independence of planning participants resulting in suboptimal planning outcomes. This article argues that crowd sourcing and public judgement using public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) can result in better planning outcomes. The wisdom of crowds refers to a phenomenon where collective opinion generates superior solutions to a problem than can be obtained by any individual in the group; public judgement refers to high-quality public opinion that is firm, consistent and mindful of consequences. PPGIS is a means to operationalise and translate the wisdom of crowds and public judgement into spatially explicit information for land use decisions. This article presents the conditions for engaging crowd wisdom and public judgement using PPGIS to collect spatially explicit planning information, followed by examples that illustrate the benefits. Technology exists to expand the use of PPGIS for planning, but there is resistance from influential segments of society that do not trust the wisdom of crowds. Innovators within planning practice are encouraged to provide opportunities to test and evaluate crowd-sourced planning solutions.	10.1080/07293682.2015.1034147	WOS:000361212500003	2015	Engaging the wisdom of crowds and public judgement for land use planning using public participation geographic information systems
135	Recent advances in Web technologies have opened avenues to create socio-technical platforms that can empower citizens in urban planning processes. The rise of the GeoWeb and the popularity of Web 2.0 collaborative tools can facilitate the development of a new generation of bottom-up Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) platforms that can incorporate user-generated content into Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). New service-based delivery mechanisms can provide architectural flexibility and adaptability, and enable the public to benefit from ubiquitous information access. From an e-participation perspective, Web 2.0 social networking functions support interactive communication among various PPGIS stakeholders, e.g., citizens, planners, and decision makers. The main contribution of this article is to present a reference architecture for e-planning platforms that (1) facilitates effective e-participation by allowing multidirectional map-based communication among various land development stakeholders (e.g., planners, decision makers, citizens, etc.), and (2) enables incorporation of visualization, evaluation, and discussion capabilities to support community planning processes. To achieve this, we developed a service-oriented architecture (SOA) that exploits SDI principles and Web 2.0 technologies. The platform architecture allows heterogeneous data sources, analytical functionality and tools, and presentation frameworks to be plugged into a coherent system to provide a planning and decision support platform. We present two real-world implementations of the proposed architecture that have been developed to support community engagement in the City of Calgary, Canada.	10.1080/13658816.2015.1008492	WOS:000359723200001	2015	A service-oriented architecture to enable participatory planning
309	To improve communication between reindeer-herders and other land users, we developed and implemented a system to produce reindeer husbandry plans together with Sami reindeer-herding communities. A central component of our communications strategy was the introduction and use of a participatory GIS (pGIS). We evaluated the potential and limitations of pGIS as a tool for collaborative learning. We concluded that by merging traditional and scientific knowledge in a pGIS, the process of spatial communication has contributed to a more inclusive planning process, and to improved knowledge-sharing. Furthermore, the process has contributed to a more efficient long-term perspective where land use planning focuses on key areas but with solutions applied to the landscape. The Model Forest offered an appropriate platform to facilitate the process.

136	Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) is a very broad field, and because of the direct outgrowth addressing questions raised regarding inequitable access to GIS and its societal impacts, PPGIS has become an exhaustive research area. Over the past two decades, several PPGIS initiatives have taken place in the western and non-western world. Several avenues have opened up, but nonetheless, questions regarding the effectiveness of such initiatives remain to be answered. Current research addressing the societal and political impacts of GIS have witnessed novel use of the technology and specialized spatial data provision such as volunteered geographic information, neogeography, geoweb, and map 2.0 (Goodchild, 2007; Elwood 2010; Sui 2008) and have received increased attention from GIS scholars (Goodchild 2007; Elwood 2009; Sui 2008). A common thread tying such specialized use of technology is the participation by citizens with little or no GIS training, a long standing objective of the PPGIS area of inquiry. So, as we move into an era that is gravitating rapidly toward more specialized use of technology built on a similar foundation, it seems timely to reflect on the effectiveness and sustainability of PPGIS initiatives. This article reviews the history of PPGIS, its genesis, and some of the critical work within the PPGIS research arena. Finally, the paper reflects on where PPGIS stands today.	10.1111/gec3.12223	WOS:000364300700002	2015	Public Participatory GIS
137	Robust risk assessment requires accurate flood intensity area mapping to allow for the identification of populations and elements at risk. However, available flood maps in West Africa lack spatial variability while global datasets have resolutions too coarse to be relevant for local scale risk assessment. Consequently, local disaster managers are forced to use traditional methods such as watermarks on buildings and media reports to identify flood hazard areas. In this study, remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques were combined with hydrological and statistical models to delineate the spatial limits of flood hazard zones in selected communities in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Benin. The approach involves estimating peak runoff concentrations at different elevations and then applying statistical methods to develop a Flood Hazard Index (FHI). Results show that about half of the study areas fall into high intensity flood zones. Empirical validation using statistical confusion matrix and the principles of Participatory GIS show that flood hazard areas could be mapped at an accuracy ranging from 77% to 81%. This was supported with local expert knowledge which accurately classified 79% of communities deemed to be highly susceptible to flood hazard. The results will assist disaster managers to reduce the risk to flood disasters at the community level where risk outcomes are first materialized.	10.3390/w7073531	WOS:000359898800017	2015	Modeling Flood Hazard Zones at the Sub-District Level with the Rational Model Integrated with GIS and Remote Sensing Approaches
138	ObjectivesThe purpose of this program development and evaluation project was to promote healthy families and communities by creating academic-practice partnerships, educating BSN students and building family-nursing student partnerships that were supported by a village of interconnected resources. Design and SampleA mixed-methods design was used for the project. Data were collected from a convenience sample of vulnerable families, BSN students engaged in PHN practica, and partner members. MeasuresNine tools were developed to capture data over two semesters including a GIS mapping strategy. ResultsOne hundred and seventy-five home visits were completed with 20 families, 14 of whom needed interpreter assistance. Families reported satisfaction with the quality of home visits, education, and assistance toward health goals. Fifty-three students provided 202 educational interventions, 39 community resource connections, and 46 care transitions. Students reported linking theory with practice and valued the PHN practicum experience. Academic-practice partners identified opportunities for program development and sustainability. GIS mapping illustrated complex family linkages to community resources. ConclusionsResults suggest that young, vulnerable families benefit from public health nursing (PHN) home visits, but sustaining home visit programs is challenging. Academic-practice partnerships can guide students and families partnered in a reciprocal relationship with village resources.	10.1111/phn.12135	WOS:000358334600006	2015	Academic-Practice Partnership in Public Health Nursing
139	Public lands provide significant environmental, economic, and social values to society across a range of classifications and tenures. Stakeholders representing multiple interests are presumed to hold different management preferences for these lands. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate how stakeholder perspectives can influence place-based management preferences for public lands. We developed a multidimensional public land preference scale and used cluster analysis of responses to classify individuals (n = 1507) into stakeholder groups using data collected from a large public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey in Victoria, Australia. We analyzed the results of the two largest stakeholder groups (identified as \\Preservation\\" and \\"Recreation\\") to assess their spatial preferences for public land conservation, access, and development. We developed a method to assess the level of spatial stakeholder agreement, with the results identifying geographic areas of both agreement and disagreement between stakeholder groups. To determine the effects of unequal stakeholder participation in mapping, we performed sensitivity analysis by weighting the responses of the Recreation stakeholder group to approximate the mapping effort of the Preservation stakeholder group. The place-based management preferences changed significantly for conservation/development and improving/limiting public land access, while preferences for increasing/limiting facility development were less sensitive to stakeholder weighting. The spatial mapping of stakeholder preferences appears effective for identifying locations with high potential for conflict as well as areas of agreement, but would benefit from further research in a range of land management applications to provide further guidance on the analysis of stakeholder group responses that result from diverse stakeholder group participation.

140	Numerous exegeses have been written about the epistemologies of volunteered geographic information (VGI). We contend that VGI is itself a socially constructed epistemology crafted in the discipline of geography, which when re-examined, does not sit comfortably with either GIScience or critical GIS scholarship. Using insights from Albert Borgmann's philosophy of technology we offer a critique that, rather than appreciating the contours of this new form of data, truth appears to derive from traditional analytic views of information found within GIScience. This is assisted by structures that enable VGI to be treated as independent of the process that led to its creation. Allusions to individual emancipation further hamper VGI and problematise participatory practices in mapping/geospatial technologies (e.g. public participation geographic information systems). The paper concludes with implications of this epistemological turn and prescriptions for designing systems and advancing the field to ensure nuanced views of participation within the core conceptualisation of VGI.	10.1002/geo2.10	WOS:000383715300002	2015	The epistemology(s) of volunteered geographic information
141	We review public participation GIS (PPGIS) and participatory GIS (PGIS) approaches for ecosystem services to identify current and best practice. PPGIS/PGIS are spatially explicit methods that have evolved over the past decade to identify a range of ecosystem services. Although PPGIS/PGIS methods demonstrate high potential for the identification of ecosystem services, especially cultural services, there has been no review to evaluate the methods to identify best practice. Through examination of peer-reviewed, empirical PPGIS/PGIS studies, we describe the types of ecosystem services mapped, the spatial mapping methods, the sampling approaches and range of participants, the types of spatial analyses performed, and the methodological trade-offs associated with each PPGIS/PGIS mapping approach. We found that multiple methods were implemented in nearly 30 case studies worldwide with the mapping of cultural and provisioning services being most common. There was little evidence that mapped ecosystem data was used for actual decision support in land use planning. Best practice has yet to coalesce in this field that has been dominated by methodological pluralism and case study research. We suggest greater use of experimental design and long-term case studies where the influence of mapped ecosystem services on land use decisions can be assessed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

142	Assuming the huge progress achieved in public participatory geographic information system (PPGIS) techniques and its current research gaps, this study aims to explore differences in the perception of spatial distribution of ecosystem services supply and demand between different stakeholders through collaborative mapping. The stakeholders selected included high influence stakeholder (with a high degree of interest on the ecosystem services' stare and with an important influence into the environmental decision making process) and low influence stakeholders (with a high degree of interest on the ecosystem services' state and with a low influence in environmental management). Workshops took place in June 2013 in two regions of Andalusia; overall 29 participants were involved. Water provision, food from agriculture, livestock, erosion control, climate regulation, water purification, nature tourism, recreational hunting and tranquility were collaboratively mapped. Agriculture land-use and the protected area surface were also assessed in order to Find patterns in ecosystem services supply, meanwhile the role of urban areas was assessed for ecosystem services demand. The results show that low and high influence stakeholders have different perceptions of the spatial distribution of ecosystem services and the scale of their demand. We call for the recognition of these knowledge differences (experiential and technical) and their inclusion in decision making processes regarding landscape planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

143	Economic and biophysical assessments are being used to portray the value of ecosystem services (ES) to decision makers. However, stakeholder uses of ES are rarely considered, nor are intangible cultural values. Public participatory GIS methods enabled for 16 cultural and provisioning ES indicators to be effectively mapped across seven stakeholder groups in an area lacking data. During interviews, polygons representing ES use were drawn by participants and then subsequently analyzed to produce areas of overlapping use, generating ES hotspots for each group, for cultural and provisioning ES, and for all groups combined. In many cases, cultural ES were deemed to be more important to stakeholders than provisioning ES. We demonstrate an effective non-economic tool used to visualize ES use across eight differing stakeholder groups on a regional scale, which were straightforward to disseminate during a decision-making process for a large hydroelectric dam.

144	On April 27, 2011, an EF-4 tornado struck Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Historic damage from the storm coincided with a recessionary economy, a double blow from which the city has yet to recover. This study applied disaster vulnerability theory to a mixed-methods analysis involving qualitative research, photography, and geographic information systems (GIS) analysis in order to document the recovery of three neighborhoods in the tornado zone. One measure of progress is easy to see. Two neighborhoods, both financially stable, have been rebuilt. The third neighborhood has lagged behind the other two, although residents, community leaders, and city planners seek to revitalize this blighted community. Tuscaloosa's experience suggests that prestorm vulnerabilities lead to uneven recovery and proposals for the gentrification of poor neighborhoods that reproduce preexisting patterns of residential segregation.	10.1111/cico.12105	WOS:000356626000009	2015	Building Back
145	Background: The aim of the Activating Schoolyards Study is to develop, implement, document and assess a comprehensive schoolyard intervention to promote physical activity (PA) during school recess for primary school children (grade 4-8). The intervention is designed to implement organizational and structural changes in the physical environment. Method: The study builds on a quasi-experimental study design using a mixed method approach including: 1) an exploratory study aimed at providing input for the developing process; 2) an evaluation of the effect of the interventions using a combination of accelerometer, GPS and GIS; 3) a process evaluation facilitating the intervention development process and identifying barriers and facilitators in the implementation process; 4) a post-intervention end-user evaluation aimed at exploring who uses the schoolyards and how the schoolyards are used. The seven project schools (cases) were selected by means of an open competition and the interventions were developed using a participatory bottom-up approach. Discussion: The participatory approach and case selection strategy make the study design novel. The use of a mixed methods design including qualitative as well as quantitative methods can be seen as a strength, as the different types of data complement each other and results of one part of the study informed the following parts. A unique aspect of our study is the use of accelerometers in combination with GPS and GIS in the effect evaluation to objectively determine where and how active the students are in the schoolyard, before and after the intervention. This provides a type of data that, to our knowledge, has not been used before in schoolyard interventions. Exploring the change in behavior in relation to specific intervention elements in the schoolyard will lead to recommendations for schools undergoing schoolyard renovations at some point in the future.	10.1186/s12889-015-1828-9	WOS:000355302900002	2015	Activating schoolyards
315	The geoweb represents a profound shift within regimes of the production, dissemination, and institutionalization of geographic information. Going beyond early geographic accounts of the geoweb that engage it as an extension of Web 2.0, this paper situates the emergence of the geoweb within the neoliberal political economic restructuring of the state. Drawing upon evidence of state, market, and citizen practices around Web-based spatial media and geoinformation, I argue that as the state is 'rolling back' from public aspects of the cartographic project, market regimes of governance are simultaneously 'rolling out', subsuming the mapping enterprise to the imperatives of technoscientific capitalism.	10.1177/0309132511411231	WOS:000299290900004	2012	Situating the geoweb in political economy
146	Alpine environments are increasingly appreciated by nature-based tourism, notwithstanding recent economic crises. To benefit from this and maintain the attractiveness of a tourist destination, it is important to recognise the values of landscapes. We developed and tested a qualitative spatial valuation methodology, integrating existing quantitative survey methods, to support destination management and landscape planning at the local level. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and a mapping exercise at a nature-based tourism destination in northern Italy. In identifying and mapping tourists' perceived landscape values and related threats, we also considered tourist profiles, experiences and preferences. The results indicated three tourist types (active seniors, families and sportive visitors). They identified five different landscape values (scenic, outdoor activity, aesthetic, historical-cultural and tranquillity) and seven categories of threats (urbanisation, lack of maintenance, congestion, visual and/or acoustic disturbance, pollution, overuse, and traffic). The maps show diverse 'tourism landscapes' and provide useful insights into sites with high value or with potential conflict between rival uses, which can effectively ground proposals for the management of valued sites and support local spatial planning to maintain perceived landscape values.	10.1080/01426397.2014.902921	WOS:000353395600004	2015	Mapping Alpine Landscape Values and Related Threats as Perceived by Tourists
147	Driven by the rise of Web 2.0 and the non-stop spread of mobile device sensors, the concept of Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) is knowing a revolutionary era which perfectly fits the new vision of Digital Earth (DE). This research investigates the opportunity to build up a PPGIS prototype with completely Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) architecture, in which data directly come from field surveys carried out by users. A sample application related to urban monitoring is addressed, which concentrates on user field-collected data concerning reports of road pavement damages. Open Data Kit suite allows users to collect geotagged multimedia information using mobile devices with onboard location sensors (e.g. a Global Positioning System receiver). On field-captured data are sent to a server and stored into a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS spatial extension. GeoServer then disseminates data on the Web. On the client-side, different solutions allow data visualization on both desktop computers and mobile devices. The designed architecture provided support for FOSS usage in the process of gathering, uploading, and Web publishing information collected in situ. The implementation of the developed PPGIS could thus substantially increase public active participation in data creation and sharing, besides enlarging DE knowledge up to the local level.	10.1080/17538947.2014.887150	WOS:000351910000001	2015	Public Participation GIS
148	The immediacy of locational information requirements and importance of data currency for natural disaster events highlights the value of volunteered geographic information (VGI) in all stages of disaster management, including prevention, preparation, response, and recovery. The practice of private citizens generating online geospatial data presents new opportunities for the creation and dissemination of disaster-related geographic data from a dense network of intelligent observers. VGI technologies enable rapid sharing of diverse geographic information for disaster management at a fraction of the resource costs associated with traditional data collection and dissemination, but they also present new challenges. These include a lack of data quality assurance and issues surrounding data management, liability, security, and the digital divide. There is a growing need for researchers to explore and understand the implications of these data and data practices for disaster management. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge in this emerging field and present recommendations for future research. Significantly, we note further research is warranted in the pre-event phases of disaster management, where VGI may present an opportunity to connect and engage individuals in disaster preparation and strengthen community resilience to potential disaster events. Our investigation of VGI for disaster management provides broader insight into key challenges and impacts of VGI on geospatial data practices and the wider field of geographical science.	10.1111/gec3.12213	WOS:000364297400002	2015	A Review of Volunteered Geographic Information for Disaster Management
149	Thirteen onshore wind farm projects, totalling approximately 700 wind turbines, are proposed for the West Coast Region (WCR) of the Western Cape Province in South Africa. Wind energy exploitation possesses the ability to transform what can be classified as natural landscapes into landscapes of power, making the type of landscape on which wind turbines are deployed a prominent factor in its social acceptance or rejection. This paper examines the landscape aesthetics and land use interference of proposed wind farms in the WCR of South Africa through determining if social acceptance or rejection of proposed wind farms is dependent on the residents and visitors scenic and land use valuation of the natural landscape. The results indicate that the visual intrusion of wind turbines is the impact that respondents are least concerned with contrasting with the findings of international literature and further reasons for this anomaly are interrogated against the background of South Africa's dire electricity needs. The paper concludes that visual impact assessments alone are not sufficient for evaluating landscapes and this paper recommends that participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) be used in addition to existing wind energy landscape assessments.

150	This paper seeks to understand the use and the consequences of Participatory Geographic Information System (PGIS) in a Mexican local community. A multilevel framework was applied, mainly influenced by two theoretical lenses structurationist view and social shaping of technology structured in three dimensions context, process and content according to contextualist logic. The results of our study have brought two main contributions. The first is the refinement of the theoretical framework in order to better investigate the implementation and use of Information and Communication Technology (ICI) artifacts by local communities for social and environmental purposes. The second contribution is the extension of existing IS (Information Systems) literature on participatory practices through identification of important conditions for helping the mobilization of ICT as a tool for empowering local communities.	10.1590/S0034-759020150305	WOS:000354594900005	2015	Use and Consequences of Participatory Gis in a Mexican Municipality
151	Sociospatial information is critical to marine and coastal ecosystem management. The Hawaii Coastal Uses Mapping Project used a participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) methodology to gather local knowledge regarding the location and intensity of coastal human activities in Hawaii's priority sites for coral reef management. PGIS provided an efficient and effective means of obtaining information in a data-poor context, particularly at a scale and location where considerable local knowledge is held by community members and resource users. We detail the PGIS methods developed to collect sociospatial data on human uses in the project regions and discuss important considerations regarding the practice of PGIS that emerged from the mapping process, as well as implications for the production and documentation of spatial knowledge. Key themes include: issues of scale and appropriateness in using PGIS as a method for mapping human coastal and marine activities; data validity, authority, and the nature of local knowledge; community trust, engagement, and collaboration; and utility for coral reef management. While several factors limit local agencies' ability to use this spatial information to date, natural resource managers found the participatory mapping process to be highly valuable for stakeholder identification and engagement, and the maps provide a resource to state and federal managers to better understand the human implications of future management scenarios.

152	The last 30 years has seen an increase in environmental, socio-economic, and recreational objectives being considered throughout the forest planning process. In the Finnish context these are considered mainly at the regional level potentially missing out on more local issues and problems. Such local information would be most efficiently collected with a participatory GIS approach. A mobile participatory GIS application called Tienoo was developed as a tool for collecting location-specific opinions of recreational and aesthetical characteristics of forests and forest management. The application also contains information the user can access regarding the practical details of the area, for instance about the recreational infrastructure. The application was tested in Ruunaa National Hiking Area, North Karelia, Eastern Finland. Through this application it is possible to continuously collect geolocated preference information. As a result, the collected opinions have details which can be located in both time and space. This allows for the possibility to monitor the changes in opinions when the stands are treated, and it also allows for easily analyzing the effect of time of year on the opinions. It is also possible to analyze the effect of the spatial location and the forest characteristics on the opinions using GIS analysis.	10.1007/s00267-014-0438-0	WOS:000351838300016	2015	A Mobile Phone Application for the Collection of Opinion Data for Forest Planning Purposes
153	Increasingly online public access to satellite imagery and the development of qualitative GIS have, in principle, the potential to provide action- and strategic planning approaches with more economical spatial information to monitor and plan physical urban transformation. This is of particular use in rapidly urbanising contexts in the global South, where lack of resources prompted the development of rapid and participatory urban appraisal techniques since the 1990s. However, in such contexts weak institutional capacity, unclear responsibilities and poor integration among key actors may still be major barriers to effective decision-making and implementation of strategic land use plans. In addition, as most urban expansion is driven by popular demand, understanding the nature of this demand has to be the basis for effective supply of urban land etc. This means exploring change in important core social and cultural values, as well as participatory engagement with key stakeholders on immediate and mid-term strategic objectives. This paper reflects on the experience of an Urban Development Priority Action Strategy being developed for the city of Huambo, Angola, by the city administration in partnership with local NGO Development Workshop (DW), with support from a European academic institution, the Centre for Environment & Human Settlements (CEHS). This initiative seeks to embed trans-disciplinarity in a meaningfill manner at the local level to permit the identification and implementation of a realistic set of priority actions. This paper reports on the type of information and understanding that is generated through this approach, as well as on the de facto constraints and boundaries that are created by the relationships between the key stakeholders, their capacities and interests. It also illustrates the more immediate and short-term results that can be achieved through this approach in comparison with traditional master planning approaches including key stakeholder engagement with identified actions and proposal of new organisational and financial models for urban land development and management as well as highlighting the advantages of mutual knowledge exchange between praxis and research.

154	Context Recent papers on the spatial assessment of conservation opportunity have focused on how social values for conservation may change modeled conservation outcomes. Accounting for social factors is important for regional wildlife corridor initiatives as they often emphasize the collaborative aspects of conservation planning. Objectives We present an approach for characterizing the potential effects of public conservation orientation and projected future development land use scenarios on landscape connectivity. Methods Using public participation GIS techniques (mail-based surveys linked to a mapping component), we classified spatially explicit conservation values and preferences into a conservation orientation index consisting of positive, negative, or neutral scores. Connectivity was then modeled using a least-cost path and graph-network approach for a range of conservation orientation and development scenarios in the Lower Hunter region, Australia. Scenarios were modelled through either adding vegetation (positive orientation) or removing vegetation (negative orientation, development). Results Scenarios that included positive conservation orientation link the isolated eastern and western reaches of the Lower Hunter, even when negative conservation scores were included in the model. This outcome is consistent with proposed connectivity corridors identified in regional strategies. The development scenario showed connectivity patterns similar to only modelling negative conservation orientation scores, with greater fragmentation across the region. Conclusions The modeled outcomes showed consistency between the public's conservation orientation and the ecological rationale for increasing connectivity within the region. If conservation orientation can be translated into conservation initiatives, the result will be enhanced regional landscape connectivity that is both ecologically beneficial, as well as socially acceptable.	10.1007/s10980-015-0153-0	WOS:000350360100010	2015	Modeling the impact of future development and public conservation orientation on landscape connectivity for conservation planning

156	Critical GIS emphasized the ways in which social, political, and economic inequalities are (re)produced through spatial information technologies and attendant practices. In the mid-1990s through the early 2000s, feminist interventions challenged the presumed gender neutrality and universality of GIS and brought gender to the fore of Critical GIS concerns. However, the rise of nascent web-based spatial information technologiesor new spatial mediasignals the need to extend this work to determine how it is that gender matters differently in this newly diversified, pervasive, and public context of geographic information technologies. Building on an analysis of online commentaries and an assessment of the functions and promotional material of several illustrative applications, we argue that gender continues to matter vis-a-vis new spatial media in three key dimensions: i) new practices of data creation and curation; ii) affordances of new technologies; and iii) new digital spatial mediations of everyday life.	10.1111/cag.12093	WOS:000352007300022	2015	Feminist geographies of new spatial media
157	In the 20 years that have passed since the fabled Friday Harbor meetings of November 1993, where GIS practitioners and critical human geographers agreed to a cease-fire, the GIS & Society agenda has been reflected upon, pushed forward, and diffracted in few (but intellectually significant) arenas. Critical, participatory, public participation, and feminist GIS have given way more recently to qualitative GIS, GIS and non-representational theory, and the spatial digital humanities. Traveling at the margins of these efforts has been a kind of social history of mapping and GIS. And while GIScience has been conversant and compatible with many of these permutations in the GIS & Society agenda, a social history of mapping and GIS (as signaled most directly by John Pickles in ) has perhaps the least potential for tinkering with GIScience practice (see conversation between Agnieszka Leszczynski and Jeremy Crampton in 2009). Perhaps this disconnect is growing, as can be witnessed in the feverish emergence of a big data analytics/visualization perspective within the contemporary GISciences (alongside the growth of funding paths around cyberinfrastructure). What then is the relevance and role of a social history of GIS for GIScience practice? In this viewpoint, I sketch and reflect upon a diversity of efforts that address this question.	10.1111/cag.12118	WOS:000352007300023	2015	New lines?
158	Binaries, the most reductive form of categorization, can be usefully invoked to characterize emerging phenomena; yet, they are widely critiqued for oversimplifying a complex world and for their use as tools of social and political influence. Through a literature review and content analysis this article traces the emergence of volunteered geographic information (VGI), and identifies the recurrent use of several related binaries to contrast this phenomenon with the conventional spatial data production activities of states and corporations. Using several key examples, these binaries are deconstructed by identifying a mismatch in how VGI is conceptualized (bottom-up, amateur, asserted) in the literature and the reality of existing VGI projects. As an alternative to a binary conceptualization of spatial data production, a different representation is put forward that more accurately depicts what is in actuality a vast, shifting, and heterogeneous landscape of spatial data production approaches. Thinking about contemporary spatial data production not as a binary but as a continuum could encourage the development of hybridities that harness the benefits of different approachesincluding the oversight and quality control of conventional methods, with the speed, low cost, and distributed nature of citizen-based spatial data production.	10.1111/cag.12119	WOS:000352007300024	2015	Deconstructing the binaries of spatial data production
159	The popularity of geotagged social media has provided many research opportunities for geographers and GIScientists in the digital age. This article reviews innovative approaches to studying spatially linked social media, and applies lessons taken from qualitative GIS and geographic visualization to improve these approaches. I introduce the idea of code clouds as a potential technique for the qualitative geovisualization of spatial information. Code clouds can depict and visualize analytic codes, or codes identifying key ideas and themes, that are generated through digital qualitative research. Rather than transforming qualitative forms of data into categories or numbers, code clouds attempt to preserve and represent the context of data as a visualized outcome of qualitative analysis. I use examples from an exploratory case study of geotweets in King County, WA, to demonstrate how code clouds can be applied to the production of meanings through qualitative geovisualization.	10.1111/cag.12133	WOS:000352007300025	2015	Code clouds

161	In the current study we investigated the extent to which neighbourhood preferences could be used as a base to group people in order to explore their residential and travel choices. The basic idea of this study was that the preferences people would have for their residential and travel choices might be a robust predictor of their actual travel behaviour, and that the neighbourhood preferences might distinguish people in terms of the characteristics of their living environment. We used a moderation model to test whether the effect of built environment on travel behaviour varied in terms of resident's type. A total of 3403 inhabitants of the city of Tampere in Finland participated in the study. A web-based public participation GIS survey combining the questionnaires with a map (SoftGIS technique) was used to collect the data. We identified two distinct groups of residents in terms of general neighbourhood preferences. The findings showed that clustering residents based on neighbourhood preferences moderated the association between some features of density measures and travel behaviour. We found significant differences between the two clusters in both the frequencies and the distance of pedestrian and bike travel. The findings revealed that inhabitants of neighbourhoods with a larger percentage of green surroundings had a greater perception of neighbourhood stability than did the residents of neighbourhoods with a smaller percentage of green surroundings.

162	The concept of place attachment has been studied extensively across multiple disciplines but only recently with empirical measurement using public participation GIS (PPGIS) and related crowd-sourcing mapping methods. This research trialed a spatially explicit method for identifying place attachment in a regional study in South Australia. Our research objectives were to (1) analyze and present the spatial results of the mapping method as a benchmark for future research, (2) compare mapped place attachment to the more common practice of mapping landscape values in PPGIS that comprise a values home range, (3) identify how participant socio-demographic and home location attributes influence place attachment, (4) provide some guidance for mapping place attachment in future research. We found large spatial variability in individual place attachment and mapped landscape values using both area and distance-based measures. The area of place attachment is influenced by occupational roles such as farming or conservation, as well as home location, especially in coastal versus non-coastal contexts. The spatial distribution of mapped landscape values or values home range is related to, but not identical to mapped place attachment with just over half of landscape values located outside the area of mapped place attachment. Economic livelihood values, as an indicator of place dependence, and social values, as an indicator of place identity, are more likely to be mapped within the place attachment area. Aggregated place attachment across participants in the region showed similar spatial intensity to aggregated values home range, but area-based assessment of place attachment and values home range are distorted by edge effects such as a coastline. To further develop the mapping of place attachment in PPGIS, we identify knowledge gaps from our study and offer suggestions for future research design. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

164	Recent attempts to integrate geographic information systems (GIS) and participatory techniques have given rise to terminologies such as participatory GIS and community-integrated GIS. Little has been published about the usefulness of participatory GIS, especially for purposes of flood risk assessment in Zimbabwe. This paper attempts to address this research gap and demonstrates that when combined with participatory methodologies, GIS can provide a mechanism for assessing flood extend in flood-prone communities of Chadereka in Muzarabani communal lands. Flood risk is increasing in the flood-prone areas in Zimbabwe, especially in remote areas where gauging stations are nonexistent because of lack of hydrometeorological and climate data for these areas, historical and projected flood events cannot be assessed through modelling. The spatial extent of the flood zone of the December 2007 flash flood event that took place in Chadereka area was mapped using participatory geographic information systems (PGIS), as well as the data collected through interviews that were held with key informants and focus group discussions. Using this approach, a flood extend assessment map was drawn by triangulating the resultant 12 PGIS maps produced by the local community. The results of the study suggest that if conventional GIS and flood modelling is cross checked with PGIS and fieldwork results, the spatial characteristics of floods in ungauged flood-prone areas can be improved and enable the profiling of floods in Chadereka ward.	10.1007/s12517-014-1265-6	WOS:000350489900033	2015	A participatory approach in GIS data collection for flood risk management, Muzarabani district, Zimbabwe
165	A significant barrier to the use of public participation GIS (PPGIS) and crowd-sourcing for conservation planning is uncertainty about the quality of the spatial data generated. This study examines the quality of PPGIS data for use in conservation planning. We evaluate two dimensions of spatial data quality, positional accuracy and data completeness using empirical PPGIS data from a statewide study of public lands in Victoria, Australia. Using an expert-derived spatial conservation model for Victoria as a benchmark, we quantify the performance of a crowd-sourced public in their capacity to accurately and comprehensively identify areas of high conservation importance in the PPGIS process. About 70% of PPGIS points that identified biological/conservation values were spatially coincident (position accurate) with modeled areas of high conservation importance, with greater accuracy associated with locations in existing protected areas. PPGIS data had less positional accuracy when participants identified biological values in urban areas and on non-public lands in general. The PPGIS process did not comprehensively identify all the largest, contiguous areas of high conservation importance in the state, missing about 20% of areas, primarily on small public land units in less densely populated regions of the state. Preferences for increased conservation/protection were over-represented in areas proximate to the Melbourne urban area and under-represented in more remote statewide locations. Our results indicate that if PPGIS data is to be integrated into spatial models for conservation planning, it is important to account for the spatial accuracy and completeness limitations identified in this study (i.e., urban areas, non-public lands, and smaller remote locations). The spatial accuracy and completeness of PPGIS data in this study suggests spatial data quality may be \\good enough\\" to complement biological data in conservation planning but perhaps not good enough to overcome the mistrust associated with crowd-sourced knowledge. Recommendations to improve PPGIS data quality for prospective conservation planning applications are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

166	This article examines the idea of the 'archive city': a spatiotemporal construct oriented around the central metaphor of the 'city as archive'. Surfing the cusp between the material and immaterial, the tangible and intangible, the embodied and virtual, the producer and consumer and - not least - the analogue and the digital, the archive city denotes a conceptualization of 'archival space' that straddles the material and symbolic city and which invites reflection on the ways cultural geographies of memory - in this case those specific to cities and other urban landscapes - are enfolded across the multi-sited and multilayered spaces of everyday urban practice. Reframing the ontological question of 'what is the archive in the digital age?' in terms of 'where is the archive?', in the first part of the article I survey the theoretical precincts of the archive city before moving on to discuss how we might conceive of a digital spatial humanities in which this more open and purposefully elusive conceptualization of the archive can productively inform debates and practices relating to urban cultural memory. The article then discusses two case studies, both of which map the cinematic geographies of cities: Liverpool in the northwest of England and Bologna in Italy. The article ends with some concluding thoughts on the role of digital spatial humanities in urban-based cultural memory studies and the broader theoretical and practical implications this has in relation to digital and 'open' archival practices.	10.1177/1354856514560310	WOS:000369729100007	2015	Navigating the 'archive city'

This study uses sketch maps and qualitative Geographic Information Systems to document the changing perceptions of 43 youth aged 14-18 during their participation in a university program.

This article describes the creation of a fine-scale spatial representation of lobster fishing activity along the Maine coast of the United States using a combination of participatory geographic information systems (GIS) and dasymetric mapping methods. These methods are employed here to support data collection from a large number of active lobster harvesters while maintaining individual privacy. The resulting representation of the fishery is designed as a planning tool for identifying potential interactions between marine resources and human activities.	10.1080/00330124.2014.883956	WOS:000347528600010	2015	A Dasymetric Map of Maine Lobster Trap Distribution Using Local Knowledge
169	Open-source and collaborative mapping projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) are designed to support community empowerment and to ensure that high-quality bias-free data are available to everyone regardless of their origin, social status and position within the power structure. In this paper, I will describe the main advantages and disadvantages of the OSM and Google Map Maker for participatory mapping. Second, I will use the example of Koffiekraal village in the North-West province, South Africa, to analyse coverage and data quality of two different data sets. Third, I will discuss a possible community project based on the spatial information gathered through the process of participatory mapping organized in Koffiekraal in the previous projects. Maps were historically used to govern cities, states and nations, to support colonial and army operations and to maintain the superior position of those with power. Participatory mapping and community empowerment are new trends in the development discourse that allow local communities to become part of the power structures and influence what is mapped and what is on the map.	10.1080/03736245.2014.924866	WOS:000346842700002	2015	How participatory mapping can drive community empowerment - a case study of Koffiekraal, South Africa
170	We introduce critical reflection mapping as a novel and hybrid research methodology for examining the sociospatial perceptions of researchers in new research settings, particularly international ones. The methodology, theoretically situated within the critical geographic information systems literature, combines two existing research methods (qualitative sketch mapping and critical reflection) to elicit original ways in which researchers can critically reflect on an area new to them while spatially linking these qualitative place-based reflections to sketch maps. The methodology allows for synergistic data sets to inform each other and to be analyzed together rather than separately. Through critical reflection mapping, we demonstrate how multiple data sets and methods are combined so that critical reflection and word clouds add significant intellectual value by making another layer of textual information immediately accessible to qualitative sketch mapping data analysis. We present two case studies in Belize and Panama from our current community geography research agendas to demonstrate the viability as well as the caveats of this novel methodology for understanding and representing the immediate sociospatial perceptions of researchers. In the context of international research experiences discussed in this article, the methodology captures individual responses to features of the built environment including walkability and sustainability; documents the changing emotions a newly immersed researcher has in a largely unfamiliar geographic setting; and connects new experiences in a foreign research setting to an individual's everyday lived experiences, positionality, and multiple identities. It also makes these experiences more visible to fellow researchers in a large research team and thus lends itself as a potential forum for shared reflection.	10.1080/00045608.2014.960041	WOS:000346244200002	2015	Critical Reflection Mapping as a Hybrid Methodology for Examining Sociospatial Perceptions of New Research Sites
171	This article explores land-tenure issues faced by Timor-Leste, specifically with reference to customary land, and the significance of mapping in resolving those difficulties. A critical review is undertaken of the pitfalls of Indigenous mapping and applications of Participatory Geographic Information Systems (PGIS) to achieve sensitive and empowering outcomes for customary groups seeking land claims. A methodology for mapping customary land in Timor-Leste is described and an analysis of the author's on-the-ground research is presented. Although the importance of customary institutions for rural land management across Timor-Leste is ascertained, this article does not advance a definitive land rights framework for the country or prescribe national mapping of customary areas. Instead, it argues for a mapping methodology to support land-use decision-making that can make sense of Indigenous knowledge and appropriate cultural practices in rural land-use claims. Identified as crucial in the process is the equal value attributed to evidence presented in myriad forms that may act as key information bridges across epistemological divides and knowledges. PGIS is a potentially important tool for resolving land-use conflicts in rural Timor-Leste when resolution occurs within a formalised institutional framework.	10.1080/00049182.2015.1080344	WOS:000371303600005	2015	Making Sense of Claims across Institutional Divides
172	In this paper I trace the origins of \\neogeography\\" (a constellation of new mapping practices and populations on the geospatial web) to its roots in computer hacker culture, notably through early mapping mashups, known originally as \\"map hacks\\". I argue that a return to the figure of the hacker-via the proposed concept of hacker cartography-offers a productive lens for understanding the affordances and limitations of participatory knowledge production on the geoweb. Drawing on theorizations of hacker communities and the \\"hacker ethic\\" in the literature, I explore how hacker politics (and their critiques) can be observed on the geoweb, using specific examples from OpenStreetMap. I argue that the figure of the hacker-a highly expert individual who nonetheless frequently contributes labor without financial compensation, often producing software and data for his or her own use-presents a fresh way to rethink the expert/novice, professional/amateur and producer/consumer axes that have frustrated geographers' theorizations of participation on the geoweb. I show how the utopian ideals of the hacker ethic offer a promising yet problematic answer to the desires of Critical GIS and Participatory GIS to create more empowered users of geospatial technology."

173	Purpose - Availability and access to food is a determinant of obesity. The purpose of this paper is to examine food availability within and outside of post-primary schools in Ireland. Design/methodology/approach - Data on the internal school food environment were collected from 63 post-primary schools using questionnaires. The external school food environment for these 63 schools was assessed by mapping food businesses within 1 km of schools, using a Geographic Information System (GIS). Food businesses were categorised based on type of food sold. Findings - A total of 68.3 per cent of schools had a canteen, 52.5 per cent had a small food shop and 37.1 per cent had a vending machine. A total of 32.7 per cent of schools reported selling chips (French fries) in their canteen while 44.2 per cent of schools reported selling energy-dense nutrient-poor foods in their school shop. Of the schools surveyed, there was an average of 3.89 coffee shops and sandwich bars, 3.65 full service restaurants, 2.60 Asian and other \\ethnic\\" restaurants, 4.03 fast food restaurants, 1.95 supermarkets, 6.71 local shops and 0.73 fruit and vegetable retailers within a 1 km radius of the post-primary schools. Findings are presented by geography (urban/rural), disadvantage (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in School (DEIS)/non DEIS), gender (girls/boys/mixed) and food policy in place at the school (yes/no). Practical implications - These data will facilitate schools working on the framework for Health Promoting Schools in Ireland. Social implications - This work can contribute to current discussions on restricting accessibility to certain foods and food premises for school children. Originality/value - The study explores the internal and external school food environment. GIS have been used to link the external food environment to specific schools thus allowing a comprehensive analysis of the schools' food environment. To the authors knowledge, this is the first time that both environments are explored simultaneously."	10.1108/HE-04-2014-0058	WOS:000355662000004	2015	Food for thought

This paper will examine the case study of the Beacon of Hope Resource Centre (BOH) whose ability to collect data, expand citizen engagement and influence policy made a positive impact upon economic development through public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) with the Regional Planning Commission and the Department of Planning and Urban Studies, University of New Orleans. This successful neighbourhood planning model provides an understanding of how PPGIS partnerships can support and encourage community engagement and economic development pre- and post-disaster.	10.1504/IJDMMM.2015.067632	WOS:000355665100003	2015	Public participation GIS and neighbourhood recovery
175	This paper investigates the relationship between cycling and mothers' mobility in Amsterdam. Considering that mothers (still) tend to be responsible for transporting children and doing so on a bicycle may increase the difficulties of travel, the city's push for cycling may not suit mothers' mobility needs. Hence, this research aimed to uncover whether mothers' physical levels and experience of mobility by bicycle are by any means inferior to childless women's in Amsterdam. Activity-travel data, collected among thirty-seven women living and working in Amsterdam, informed the results of this research. Throughout a space-time GIS analysis, mothers barely differed from childless women in their amount of and predilection for cycling: mothers generally did not consider the transport of their children on the bicycle as an exertion or safety issue, but rather as a practical means of transport and a pleasurable moment to bond with children. However, mothers and childless women often differed in their travel schedules and purposes, implying that mothers face specific mobility challenges, which evolve as children grow older.	10.1068/a140373p	WOS:000352365600013	2015	Taking the tyke on a bike
176	Medicinal plants and fungi play important roles in the health of Maliseet people of northern Maine, USA. A critical aspect of exercising choice in health care for this community is the ability to locate and have access to these plants. Habitat suitability modeling is a form of geospatial technology that can enhance health sovereignty by identifying locations in which populations of medicinal plants can be conserved or established. However, use of this technology within indigenous communities has been limited. Focusing on the medicinal plant muskrat root, Acorus americanus (Raf.) Raf., we generate a habitat suitability model for eastern Aroostook County, Maine (1,055,653.659 ha) that also takes community needs into consideration. Drawing on participatory ethnographic data as well as environmental characteristics, our model combines ecological and sociocultural parameters to identify previously unknown populations of A. americanus that are accessible to tribal elders. Our model successfully predicted 95% of A. americanus locations in our field validation data set of similar to 71,000 ha. Results suggest that approximately 0.6% of our study area contains suitable habitat to plant muskrat root that could also meet tribal members' gathering needs for the future. Increasing the number of potential collection sites gives communities options for gathering, thereby enhancing health sovereignty. Broadly, our work suggests that, when done in partnership with communities, different forms of geospatial technology can be beneficial tools for efforts to promote health sovereignty.

177	We present a participatory methodology for mapping and analyzing urban forests and greenspaces with a particular emphasis on identifying the location and intensity of non-native invasive plant species in a 180-acre nature preserve in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The research uses smart phone and tablet data collection techniques with GPS to understand the extent and intensity of non-native invasive species distributions. Inverse Distance Weighted spatial interpolation techniques are used in GIS to analyze the data. Results are field validated and presented in a series of GIS maps. Chinese Privet covered 454,639 m(2) of the mapped area. The species was found in close proximity to many small streams and a major creek. English Ivy occupied the second largest amount of total ground cover, canvassing more than 244,452 m(2). The species was generally found near residential edges of the nature preserve. As a contribution to the Public Participation GIS literature, the methodology presented in this article has practical and methodological implications for GIS and urban researchers and practitioners interested in utilizing participatory methodologies for urban forest and greenspace management, restoration efforts, and non-native invasive species monitoring.

178	It is readily accepted that understanding socio-environmental challenges requires consideration of multiple stakeholder perspectives and knowledge claims. But a largely ignored question is 'how best to analyse those competing perspectives and claims?'. This paper explores the development of one GIS-based methodology - and reports on its application - to understand and map stakeholder knowledge. We find that combining Q-methodology with participatory mapping helps to overcome a significant problem in social engagement: representing the unclear connection between what people say or do and their underlying attitudes, values or beliefs. The paper is based on a reflexive engagement with flood management and natural adaptive capacity in the Scottish-English Borderlands. The paper confirms how such topics can benefit from an appreciation of the wide range of stakeholders' positions, as well as the underlying beliefs informing those positions. Most importantly, we provide an account of our methodology, offering a template for others interested in unpacking complex socio-environmental issues. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

179	This paper develops a political-industrial ecology approach to explore the urban water metabolism of Los Angeles, which sprawls for thousands of miles across the American West. Conventional approaches to quantify urban carbon footprints rely on global, national, or regional averages and focus narrowly on improving the efficiency of flows of resources moving into and out of the city. These approaches tend to \\black box\\" the methodologies that guide the carbon emissions calculus and the social, political, ecological, and economic processes that perpetually reshape nature-society metabolisms. To more fully delineate the water supply metabolism of Los Angeles, this paper combines theory and method from urban political ecology and industrial ecology. Specifically, we infuse spatiality into the traditional life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach by coupling it with GIS. By illustrating how decisions about system boundaries, emissions factors, and other building blocks fundamentally shape the end result, this intervention at once destabilizes and advances the LCA enterprise. Then, using interviews and historical analysis, we provide a critical analysis of how LA's various water supply infrastructures came to be and illustrate how a sustainable transition based on a narrow carbon calculus is problematized by historical circumstances and strategic (and often conflicting) new paradigms to secure water resources. The political-industrial ecology approach offers valuable insights into the spatiality of material metabolisms and the socio-political processes (re)shaping the relations between nature and society.

180	New social and spatial media and other modes of pervasive computing are altering ways of knowing, remembering, and engaging across time and space. This collection explores how the digital, interactive, and collaborative nature of these technologies contributes to transformations in the nature of knowledge and memory. In particular, the contributions focus on theorizing the collective or social subjectivities and impacts of these technologically mediated rememberings. What are the processes and relationships through which shared knowledge and memory can be transmitted and transformed across time and space? How does memory become socially and politically meaningful? The contributing authors consider how new social and spatial technologies transform space/time connections, reconfigure the forms and practices through which collective memory is transmitted or attention is paid, and impact social relations.	10.1177/1474474014556062	WOS:000347412200009	2015	Technology, memory, and collective knowing
181	New web-based architectures and capacities for digital storage have made online social interactions more significant, discursively and materially. Increasingly, these media-centric shifts toward the online and the interactive have enabled for-profit and nonprofit organizations to capture the attention of potential customers and constituents through social and spatial media. In research on the everyday information- and data-practices of community-based organizations, websites and their mobile applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and Pinterest are examined as the emerging media toolset to build sustained connections to funders, constituents, and other members. These technologies and these new pressures around their utilization have made the daily work of nonprofits more complex. As the landscapes of digital media continually shift their interfaces, protocols, and membership settings (including privacy configurations), I suggest that this new normal - persistent change - presents challenges for collective memory and the attention-work of community-based organizations. Taking up and responding to concerns around the implications of digital information technologies on memory and culture, this paper highlights struggles over externalization as significant to the everyday work of collective action.	10.1177/1474474014539249	WOS:000347412200011	2015	Paying attention, digital media, and community-based critical GIS
182	Mapping approaches offer great potential for community-based participatory researchers interested in displaying youth perceptions and advocating for change. We describe a multilayered approach for gaining local knowledge of neighborhood environments that engages youths as co-researchers and active knowledge producers. By integrating geographic information systems with environmental audits, an interactive focus group, and sketch mapping, the approach provides a place-based understanding of physical activity resources from the situated experience of youths. Youths report safety and a lack of recreational resources as inhibiting physical activity. Maps reflecting youth perceptions aid policy makers in making place-based improvements for youth neighborhood environments.	10.1097/FCH.0000000000000050	WOS:000346692000008	2015	Partnering With Youth to Map Their Neighborhood Environments A Multilayered GIS Approach
183	This study present's the design and implementation of a web-based Participatory Geographic Information System (PGIS) framework intended for offshore wind suitability analysis. The PGIS prototype presented here integrates GIS and decision-making tools that are intended to involve different stakeholders and the public for solving complex planning problems and building consensus. Public involvement from the early planning stage of projects with a spatial nature is very important for future legitimacy and acceptance of these projects. Therefore, developing and executing a system that facilitates effective public involvement for resolving contentious issues can help in fostering long-lasting agreements. The prototype here is a distributed and asynchronous PGIS that combines a discussion forum, a mapping tool and a decision tool. The potential strengths and benefits of this PGIS are demonstrated in a hypothetical case study in Lake Erie, northern Ohio. In the hypothetical case study, participants evaluate the importance of three decision alternatives using different evaluation criteria for expressing their individual preferences. The individual preferences are aggregated by Borda Count (BC) method for generating the group solution, which is used for synthesizing the different evaluation aspects such as the importance of criteria, ranking of the decision alternatives and planning issues related to environmental and socio-economic concerns from the participants.

184	Volunteered geographic information (VGI) is geographic information collected by way of crowdsourcing. However, the distinction between VGI as an information product and the processes that create VGI is blurred. Clearly, the environment that influences the creation of VGI is different than the information product itself, yet most literature treats them as one and the same. Thus, this research is motivated by the need to formalize and standardize the systems that support the creation of VGI. To this end, we propose a conceptual framework for VGI systems, the main components of which-project, participants, and technical infrastructure-form an environment conducive to the creation of VGI. Drawing on examples from OpenStreetMap, Ushahidi, and RinkWatch, we illustrate the pragmatic relevance of these components. Applying a system perspective to VGI allows us to better understand the components and functionality needed to effectively create VGI.	10.3390/ijgi3041278	WOS:000358934300007	2014	A Systems Perspective on Volunteered Geographic Information
185	It is increasingly common for participatory data to be collected from the public via a PPGIS, in order to gain a greater understanding both of the world around us, and people's experience of it. The place-based thoughts and feelings of an individual do not, however, always fit well with the space-based points and polygons into which they are typically reduced in such a system, which can limit the effectiveness of many traditional PPGIS' for data collection. In order to address this issue, an alternative PPGIS platform is presented, which allows the collection, storage and analysis of spatial data from the public without the requirement to artificially reduce these data to geographic primitives. The 'Spraycan' platform allows participants to create spatial representations on a map using a familiar airbrush-style interface, permitting the creation of vague regions and boundaries that better reflect the places to which they refer. Data are stored within a 'multi-point-and-attribute' data structure whereby each individual 'dot' of 'paint' created using the airbrush is stored as a discrete geographical object, and is joined to all other associated 'dots', as well as a variety of other demographic and contextual data, including free-text data in which the participants may add context to their spray patterns. The flexibility of this data structure provides a wide and extensible variety of analytical choices for the researcher, as is shown here by an example study demonstrating the use of the Spraycan for decision-support, as well as a number of real-world 'in the wild' applications. It is hoped that this work will open up the agenda for alternative PPGIS interfaces, in order to further explore the possibilities associated with the capture and analysis of 'fuzzy' place-based data.

186	Sediment budgets are useful in informing catchment management, however the resources and data required to create a sediment budget may be prohibitive, particularly in developing countries. This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach to an investigation of sediment sources and the creation of a first-order sediment budget for a catchment in eastern Indonesia: a data-poor region in the wet-dry tropics with high sediment production rates and a population largely dependent on subsistence agriculture. The approach integrates results from geospatial analysis and key informant interviews and radionuclide tracers. Free software and imagery were used to demonstrate that geospatial analysis can be achieved without high costs. Surface soil erosion rates were mapped using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, and subsoil sediment sources were digitised from high-resolution imagery. Key informant interviews identified additional gully erosion, not detected through spatial analysis. Radionuclide tracers Cs-137, Pb-210((ex)) and Pu-239 were used to determine the relative contributions of surface soil to sediment. The main sediment sources in the Kambaniru catchment were surface soils (31%), channel change (22%), gully erosion (8%), and landslides (1%), with an estimated annual sediment load of 1440000tyr(-1) at the weir. This sediment budget showed subsoils were a major source of sediment, which contradicts assumptions that underpin Indonesian catchment management policies. The geospatial, interview and field methods were effective in identifying, mapping and quantifying subsoil sediment sources, and can readily be applied in areas where data are scarce and technical skills are low. Radionuclide tracers provide essential information but are expensive.	10.1111/geoa.12076	WOS:000345770800007	2014	Creating a Sediment Budget in a Data Poor Context
187	Many states and municipalities prohibit registered sex offenders from residing near schools or other places where children gather. Such residence restrictions are employed in order to prevent sex crimes against children by reducing sex offender access to possible victims. Although numerous academic studies suggest that residence restrictions fail to reduce crime rates or are otherwise inappropriate, the potential effectiveness of these policies has not thoroughly been evaluated from a spatial accessibility perspective. This study explores the spatial accessibility of sex offenders to public schools in a city with enforced residence restrictions, St. Louis, Missouri. The goal of the analysis is to examine how accessible schools are to sex offenders with a history of crimes against children or minors. Unlike previous studies, however, accessibility is measured not only near the place of residence but also during expected routine activities that occur away from the home, such as at the work place or during commutes. To accomplish this, methods of time geography are used to measure cumulative sex offender accessibility to schools based on the home and work addresses of registered individuals. Specifically, potential path trees are used to estimate sex offender access to schools given estimated daily travel budgets. The results show that, while few registered offenders in the city live near schools, nearly all are expected to come in close proximity to them either near the work place or during the expected journey to work. In the context of public policy, this suggests that-from a strictly spatial perspective-residence restriction laws are unlikely to achieve their goal of limiting sex offender access to school children.	10.1007/s12061-014-9116-0	WOS:000345276200005	2014	Using Potential Path Trees to Map Sex Offender Access to Schools
188	Recent conservation planning studies have presented approaches for integrating spatially referenced social (SRS) data with a view to improving the feasibility of conservation action. We reviewed the growing conservation literature on SRS data, focusing on elicited or stated preferences derived through social survey methods such as choice experiments and public participation geographic information systems. Elicited SRS data includes the spatial distribution of willingness to sell, willingness to pay, willingness to act, and assessments of social and cultural values. We developed a typology for assessing elicited SRS data uncertainty which describes how social survey uncertainty propagates when projected spatially and the importance of accounting for spatial uncertainty such as scale effects and data quality. These uncertainties will propagate when elicited SRS data is integrated with biophysical data for conservation planning and may have important consequences for assessing the feasibility of conservation actions. To explore this issue further, we conducted a systematic review of the elicited SRS data literature. We found that social survey uncertainty was commonly tested for, but that these uncertainties were ignored when projected spatially. Based on these results we developed a framework which will help researchers and practitioners estimate social survey uncertainty and use these quantitative estimates to systematically address uncertainty within an analysis. This is important when using SRS data in conservation applications because decisions need to be made irrespective of data quality and well characterized uncertainty can be incorporated into decision theoretic approaches. Caracterizacion de la Incertidumbre Espacial cuando se Integran Datos Sociales a la Planeacion de la Conservacion Estudios recientes de la planeacion de la conservacion han presentado estrategias para integrar datos sociales con referencia espacial (SRE) con miras a mejorar la viabilidad de las acciones de conservacion. Revisamos la creciente literatura de conservacion sobre los datos SRE, enfocandonos en las preferencias obtenidas o mencionadas derivadas de metodos de encuestas sociales como los experimentos de opcion y los sistemas de informacion geografica de participacion publica. Los datos SRE obtenidos incluyeron a la distribucion espacial de la disposicion de vender, de pagar, de actuar y evaluaciones de los valores culturales y sociales. Desarrollamos una tipologia para evaluar la incertidumbre de los datos SRE obtenidos, la que describe como la incertidumbre de las encuestas sociales se propaga cuando se proyecta espacialmente y la importancia de responder a la incertidumbre espacial como los efectos de escala y la calidad de datos. Estas incertidumbres se propagaran cuando los datos SRE obtenidos se integren con datos biofisicos para la planeacion de la conservacion y pueden tener consecuencias importantes para evaluar la viabilidad de las acciones de conservacion. Para explorar mas a fondo este tema, llevamos a cabo una revision sistematica de la literatura sobre datos SRE obtenidos. Encontramos que la incertidumbre de encuestas sociales se probaba comunmente, pero que estas incertidumbres se ignoraban al proyectarse espacialmente. Con base en estos resultados desarrollamos un marco de trabajo que ayudara a los investigadores y a los practicantes a estimar la incertidumbre de las encuestas sociales y a usar estos estimados cuantitativos para senalar sistematicamente a la incertidumbre dentro de un analisis. Estos es importante cuando se usan datos SRE en aplicaciones de la conservacion ya que las decisiones deben tomarse sin importar la calidad de los datos y una incertidumbre bien caracterizada puede ser incorporada a las estrategias de decision teorica.

189	Two related approaches to valuing nature have been advanced in past research including the study of ecosystem services and psychological investigations of the factors that shape behavior. Stronger integration of the insights that emerge from these two lines of enquiry can more effectively sustain ecosystems, economies, and human well-being. Drawing on survey data collected from outdoor recreationists on Santa Cruz Island within Channel Islands National Park, U.S., our study blends these two research approaches to examine a range of tangible and intangible values of ecosystem services provided to stakeholders with differing biocentric and anthropocentric worldviews. We used Public Participation Geographic Information System methods to collect survey data and a Social Values for Ecosystem Services mapping application to spatially analyze a range of values assigned to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the park. Our results showed that preferences for the provision of biological diversity, recreation, and scientific-based values of ecosystem services varied across a spatial gradient. We also observed differences that emerged from a comparison between survey subgroups defined by their worldviews. The implications emanating from this investigation aim to support environmental management decision-making in the context of protected areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

190	Greater accessibility to geospatial technologies has led to a surge of spatialized public health research, much of which has focused on food environments. The purpose of this study was to analyze differing spatial measures of exposure to supermarkets and farmers markets among women of reproductive age in eastern North Carolina. Exposure measures were derived using participant-defined neighborhoods, investigator-defined road network neighborhoods, and activity spaces incorporating participants' time space behaviors. Results showed that mean area for participant-defined neighborhoods (0.04 sq miles) was much smaller than 2.0 mile road network neighborhoods (3.11 sq. miles) and activity spaces (26.36 sq. miles), and that activity spaces provided the greatest market exposure. The traditional residential neighborhood concept may not be particularly relevant for all places. Time-space approaches capturing activity space may be more relevant, particularly if integrated with mixed methods strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

316	Emerging out of Web 2.0 there have been almost breath-taking technological advances in the geospatial web spurred on by developments in neogeography and the inter-connectivity provided by published open-source application programming interfaces. In addition, the greater availability of location-intelligent devices, social media technologies and the advent of volunteered geographic information promises to further revolutionize traditionally conceived geospatial technologies and empower a world of spatially aware citizen sensors. Together, these new Web 2.0 geospatial platforms and citizen-generated geotagged media pose significant opportunities and challenges to the traditional geospatial framework of GIS and standards-based spatial databases, and to archaeology. The new Web 2.0 geospatial capabilities enable communities of stakeholders and interest groups to contribute, participate, and draw upon spatial data and mapping services formerly in the domain of expert geospatial and archaeological communities.	10.1080/00438243.2012.736273	WOS:000312541300008	2012	Interfacing archaeology and the world of citizen sensors
191	In this paper, we demonstrate the use of scenario building in the context of contested land use visions. We examine a small coastal community located 20 kms south of Lisbon. In Almada - Trafaria/Costa da Caparica, competing stakeholders such as central government, local government, environmental NGO's and private companies each have competing development visions for the area. These include the development of recreation and leisure facilities, a container terminal and the re-naturalization of unused land. We illustrate the added value of the GIS-ANN tool in steering negotiations between these different visions and the potential of a scenario building web application as a tool for problem solving. The emergence of user-created GIS-based web content in Planning has transformed passive users and consumers of geospatial information into active contributors to the development of spatial visions of the future. It allows stakeholders to gauge alternative future land uses thus making planning and decision-making processes potentially more transparent and democratic. In this paper, we detail a new method that enhances GIS-web-based public participation. We build on a combination of GIS basic capabilities and the data mining methods of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), namely Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) packaged in a friendly (GUI) user interface that runs on the Google Earth platform. Users will be able to articulate different spatial development scenarios for a specific area, to conduct sensitivity analyses for various competing scenarios and to explore causal connections between them.

192	Abstract As the role of information and communications technologies (ICTs) grows, governments have seen the Geoweb and Web 2.0 as an opportunity to increase citizen involvement through e-government which provides citizens with the ability to record and share information. 311 services represent citizens' most direct contact with local governments in the form of volunteered geographic information (VGI) empowering citizens with the means of solving community issues. Past studies have examined VGI and e-government use finding patterns of a digital divide with survey data; yet, further research which allows for the visualization of these patterns using citizen-generated data is needed to understand the link between users and the content they create. This paper seeks to explore the relationship between sociodemographic status and 311 service request frequency in three cities within the United States using geographic information systems (GIS) and regression analysis. Results suggest the potential existence of a digital divide and that the demographic profile of a city plays a role in participation in e-government.	10.1080/10630732.2014.942167	WOS:000346829700005	2014	The Digital Divide in Citizen-Initiated Government Contacts
193	Online participation in political processes has grown in advanced industrial societies like the United States (E. Anduiza, A. Gallego, and M. Cantijoch, \\Online Political Participation in Spain: The Impact of Traditional and Internet Resources,\\" Journal of Information Technology & Politics 7: 4 (2010) 356-368). Experimentation and goal-setting have been done around integrating two-way communication into online GIS portals to advance online participation. Increasingly, web development information technology enables the development of these functions. However, the state of practice has not developed to support such activities. This paper relies on literature and a survey of US geoportals to provide an in-depth overview of the state of practice for such sites, including stated goals and challenges, current applications, and both technical and realized capabilities. This paper then discusses this state of practice through the lens of the development process of a new geoportal for the St Louis region. This discussion yields a response to issues raised in the literature and provides a framework for other groups that are considering development of similar sites."	10.1080/10630732.2014.942168	WOS:000346829700007	2014	Goals, Challenges, and Capacity of Regional Data Portals in the United States
194	The Heat Energy Assessment Technologies (HEAT) project uses high-resolution airborne thermal imagery, Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA), and a Geoweb environment to allow the residents of Calgary, Alberta, Canada to visualize the amount and location of waste heat leaving their houses, communities, and the city. To ensure the accuracy of these measures, the correct emissivity of roof materials needs to be known. However, roof material information is not readily available in the Canadian public domain. To overcome this challenge, a unique Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) application was developed using Google Street View that engages citizens to classify the roof materials of single dwelling residences in a simple and intuitive manner. Since data credibility, quality, and accuracy are major concerns when using VGI, a private Multiple Listing Services (MLS) dataset was used for cross-verification. From May-November 2013, 1244 volunteers from 85 cities and 14 countries classified 1815 roofs in the study area. Results show (I) a 72% match between the VGI and MLS data; and (II) in the majority of cases, roofs with greater than, or equal to five contributions have the same material defined in both datasets. Additionally, this research meets new challenges to the GEOBIA community to incorporate existing GIS vector data within an object-based workflow and engages the public to provide volunteered information for urban objects from which new geo-intelligence is created in support of urban energy efficiency.	10.3390/rs6109691	WOS:000344458000025	2014	Supporting Urban Energy Efficiency with Volunteered Roof Information and the Google Maps API
195	Crowdsourcing, volunteered geographic information (VGI) and citizens acting as sensors are currently being used in Australia via GeoWeb 2.0 applications for environmental sustainability purposes. This paper situates the origins of these practices, phenomena and concepts within the intersection of Web 2.0 and emerging online and mobile spatial technologies, herein called the GeoWeb 2.0. The significance of these origins is akin to a revolution in the way information is created, curated and distributed, attributed with transformative social impacts. Applications for environmental sustainability have the potential to be similarly transformative or disruptive. However, Web 2.0 is not described or conceptualised consistently within the literature. Australian examples implementing the GeoWeb 2.0 for environmental sustainability are diverse, but the reasons for this are difficult to ascertain. There is little published by the creators of such applications on their decisions, and Australian research is nascent, occurring across a variety of disciplinary approaches. While a substantial research literature emanates from North America and Europe, its transferability to Australia requires careful assessment. This paper contributes to this assessment by providing a review of relevant literature in the context of Australian examples for environmental sustainability.	10.3390/ijgi3031058	WOS:000358933800012	2014	Where 2.0 Australia's Environment?
196	Collecting spatial information on fisheries catch and effort is essential to understanding the spatial processes of exploited population dynamics and to manage heterogeneously distributed resources and uses. The use of fishers' knowledge through geographical information systems (GISs) is increasingly considered as a promising source of local information on small-scale coastal fisheries. In this paper we describe the first framework for mapping entire small-scale coastal fisheries using fishers' knowledge on catch size and fishing effort. Four mangrove and coral reef fisheries targeting invertebrates or finfish in New Caledonia (southwest Pacific) were mapped following a five-step framework: (i) stratified random sampling of regular fishers; (ii) collection of fishers' knowledge of fishing areas, fishing effort, and catch size through map-based interviews; (iii) data integration into a spatial geodatabase; (iv) statistical extrapolation of fisher data to the fishery scale; and (v) mapping of catch, effort, and catch per unit effort (CPUE) for each fishery using a GIS overlay procedure. We found evidence that fishers' knowledge supplied precise and accurate quantitative and spatial information on catch size, fishing effort and CPUE for entire fisheries. Fisheries maps captured the fine-scale spatial distribution of fishing activities in a variety of ways according to target taxa, gear type, and home ports. Applications include area-based marine conservation planning and fishery monitoring, management, and governance. This integrated framework can be generalized to a large range of data-poor coastal and inland small-scale fisheries.	10.1093/icesjms/fst204	WOS:000343315900023	2014	A framework for mapping small-scale coastal fisheries using fishers' knowledge
197	Public lands provide a wide range of values ecological, socio-cultural, and economic but systematic methods to assess the social and cultural values of public lands are underdeveloped. In this study, we present a method that uses public participation GIS (PPGIS) to identify and quantify the social and cultural values associated with different types of public land, ranging from national parks and reserves, to multiple-use lands. In 2014, we conducted a PPGIS study to identify public land values in Victoria, Australia. Over 35,000 landscape value and land use preference locations were mapped by study participants (n = 1905). We analyzed the spatial data for association with public land type, IUCN classification, and an agency level management system. We generated social landscape metrics to quantify values by individual public land units based on value abundance, richness, diversity, and the potential for management conflict. We found statistically significant associations between values and public land type, IUCN protected area classification, and management level of protection. The social landscape metrics indicate that the most highly valued public lands (national parks) have the greatest potential for management conflict, but also reveal several less iconic public lands as having high potential for management conflict. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the PPG'S methods in the study and provide suggestions to improve the process for future assessments of social and cultural values associated with public lands.

198	Sustainability of urban transportation and residents' daily mobility is increasingly important for the future of urban regions. In this paper, we present a novel methodology combining mapped survey responses (gathered using public participation GIS) and sophisticated multimodal routing analysis to understand patterns of suburban residents' daily mobility. Our particular focus is on residents' mode choices and their optimality in terms of travel time. We also examine the carbon-intensity of potential mode choice mismatches where a comparatively slower travel mode is chosen for a particular trip. This paper shows how the combination of the two data sources create new possibilities for analysing daily mobility by enabling the comparison of self-reported, geographically referenced mobility patterns and modelled, objectively \\optimal\\" patterns. Our case study results from a rapidly growing metropolitan area, Greater Helsinki in Finland, indicate that people have rather sustainable daily mobility practices. Their daily trips are typically short (median 1.8 km), and non-motorised travel modes are the most popular. Also the share of car travel is significant. While public transport clearly has the lowest modal share, it is frequently used on longer trips to destinations where public transport connections are good (particularly the city centre). In 44% of trips, the respondents choose the fastest travel mode. When a comparatively slower travel mode is chosen, it most often produces less CO2 emissions than the fastest mode. However, particularly on shopping trips the most commonly reported type of trip car driving dominates as the fastest means of transportation. When a slower mode is chosen on a shopping trip, it is typically more carbon-intensive than the fastest mode would have been in that case. The methodology presented here can be used to support local decision making, particularly when daily services and transport infrastructure are planned or reorganised. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

199	This paper critically reviews ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches for food security under climate change, specifically for the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) comprising the Africa, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China Sea (AIMS) region. The focus is on integrating different knowledge forms. An analysis of current EbA approaches for food security is undertaken, alongside a review of methodologies for integrating local and external knowledge. Key gaps and actions for EbA for food security in the AIMS region, and potentially further afield, are identified. The gaps indicate the lack of coherence in AIMS SIDS approaching food security, in terms of policies and actions not reflecting the ecosystem-food-climate nexus, the lack of a regional framework despite similarities amongst the SIDS, and the infrequency with which knowledge integration occurs. To fill these gaps, suggested actions highlight knowledge identification and combination, learning from others and from history, using local champions, and regularly monitoring and evaluating progress. These actions will push forward the EbA agenda through improved development and use of knowledge, better connections amongst the AIMS SIDS and farther afield, and more local-national-regional collaboration.	10.3390/su6095566	WOS:000342902000004	2014	Ecosystem-Based Adaptation for Food Security in the AIMS SIDS
200	In 2011 the Home Office released the police.uk website, which provided a high-resolution map of recent crime data for the national extents of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Through this free service, crimes were represented as points plotted on top of a Google map, visible down to a street level of resolution. However, in order to maintain confidentiality and to comply with data disclosure legislation, individual-level crimes were aggregated into points that represented clusters of events that were located over a series of streets. However, with aggregation the representation of crimes as points becomes problematic, engendering spurious precision over where crimes occurred. Given obvious public sensitivity to such information, there are social imperatives for appropriate representation of crime data, and as such, in this paper we present a method of translating the 'point' crime events into a new representational form that is tied to street network geography; presenting these results in an alternate national crime mapping portal http://www.policestreets.co.uk.	10.1111/area.12116	WOS:000340493600009	2014	Escaping the pushpin paradigm in geographic information science
201	Landscape change is driven by a complex combination of physical, ecological and socio-cultural drivers. Because of their inherent complexity, integrative strategies that combine social and environmental data need to be developed in landscape change research, planning and management. This is particularly true for European mountain areas, where landscapes have undergone major changes through human history, tracing back over thousands of years of continuous human intervention. Within this context the purpose of this paper is twofold: to investigate the processes governing landscape change, and to demonstrate the value of an integrative approach to improve the understanding of such changes. In order to test our approach a Mediterranean mountain area in Northeast Spain was selected. As part of the research process, quantitative data of land cover changes were paired with qualitative social assessment based on local inhabitants' perceptions of changes and identification of driving forces. Findings support that the exploration of local perceptions in addition to the quantitative spatial assessment of land cover dynamics enhances the reliability of processes of interpretation and explanation of landscape change and improves the understanding of hidden dynamics and complex driving forces.

202	The consideration of information on social values in conjunction with biological data is critical for achieving both socially acceptable and scientifically defensible conservation planning outcomes. However, the influence of social values on spatial conservation priorities has received limited attention and is poorly understood. We present an approach that incorporates quantitative data on social values for conservation and social preferences for development into spatial conservation planning. We undertook a public participation GIS survey to spatially represent social values and development preferences and used species distribution models for 7 threatened fauna species to represent biological values. These spatially explicit data were simultaneously included in the conservation planning software Zonation to examine how conservation priorities changed with the inclusion of social data. Integrating spatially explicit information about social values and development preferences with biological data produced prioritizations that differed spatially from the solution based on only biological data. However, the integrated solutions protected a similar proportion of the species' distributions, indicating that Zonation effectively combined the biological and social data to produce socially feasible conservation solutions of approximately equivalent biological value. We were able to identify areas of the landscape where synergies and conflicts between different value sets are likely to occur. Identification of these synergies and conflicts will allow decision makers to target communication strategies to specific areas and ensure effective community engagement and positive conservation outcomes.	10.1111/cobi.12257	WOS:000339501100011	2014	Integrating Biological and Social Values When Prioritizing Places for Biodiversity Conservation
203	The social construction of a land cover map is explored and the implications of this process for the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) as a land management tool are discussed. Different social contexts create different mapping regimes and contribute to different conceptions of area classes. This likely creates challenges for the mapping process, including the consistency and comparability of the final product across time and space. In this study, part of the mapping process for the Norwegian land cover map called AR5 was followed. By seeing map classes as experiential categories, light is shed on the social construction of land cover/use maps. Different administrative units involved in the mapping process have different interpretations of area classes, even if the class definitions are the same. Local administrative units are closely influenced by the realities of local farmers and tend to map land use rather than land cover, even when they are instructed by the national mapping agency to map land cover. Such a difference challenges the comparability and consistency of maps (land cover vs. land use) when they are used in GIS to detect and monitor change. Alternatively, such co-operative map-making can be seen as an opportunity for the sharing and negotiation of power between the different management groups involved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

204	Walking rates to school remain low for U.S. children in large part due to parent concern for child safety. Little research exists that identifies which features of streets and intersection lead parents to feel that walking is unsafe for their children. In this study, parent volunteers conducted an audit of streets and intersections leading to seven elementary schools in a suburban school district. Parents were most likely to feel concern about streets that lacked sidewalks or had sidewalks with obstructions. Wheelchair-accessible routes were seen as appropriate for walking children. Parents expressed concern over safety at intersections, particularly those involving large streets; traffic controls did not mollify their concern. These results support the use of appropriate behavior models for assessing walking choices, highlight the importance of well-maintained sidewalks and age-appropriate crossings for young families, and demonstrate the importance of including the public in street audits.

205	Background: Understanding the social determinants underlying health disparities benefits from a mixed-methods, participatory research approach. Objectives: Photovoice was used in a research project seeking to identify and validate existing data and models used to address socio-spatial determinants of health in at-risk neighborhoods. Methods: High-risk neighborhoods were identified using geospatial models of pre-identified social determinants of health. Students living within these neighborhoods were trained in Photovoice, and asked to take pictures of elements that influence their neighborhood's health and to create narratives explaining the photographs. Results: Students took 300 photographs showing elements that they perceived affected community health. Negative factors included poor pedestrian access, inadequate property maintenance, pollution, and evidence of gangs, criminal activity, and vagrancy. Positive features included public service infrastructure and outdoor recreation. Photovoice data confirmed and contextualized the geospatial models while building community awareness and capacity. Conclusions: Photovoice can be a useful research tool for building community capacity and validating quantitative data describing social determinants of health.

206	Rarely discussed about the Israel-Palestinian conflict is the antagonism that exists between the Palestinian leadership and the refugees. With the advent of the Oslo peace process in the 1990s, the antagonism began to escalate, for the process's key assumption became that the leadership would relinquish the refugees' right to return home so that Israel would be preserved as a majority Jewish state in exchange for the Palestinian leadership's sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Because the refugees' return home would upset the demographic balance of a Jewish-majority state, they have become impossible figures for both Israel and for the Palestinian leadership's political frame, an impossibility that is taken for granted in dominant maps of Palestine/Israel. This article highlights some ways the refugees have refused this erasure by mapping onto the land their historical presence. Taking their use of Google Earth as a case study, it begins by providing background on Google Earth, situating the software's prehistory within Cold War battles for surveillance and control. It then points to some cracks Google Earth's introduction has presented the post-Cold War political scene with: namely, that nation-states are today stumbling to control with whom maps are shared, who can make them, and what they will look like. It then moves on to show how the refugees have taken advantage of the State of Israel's (as well as the Palestinian leadership's) inability to control the map, in the process rendering the geoweb a new battlefield in the conflict. I conclude with an analysis of how cartographically placing Israel's founding and perpetual violence at the fore, as the Palestinian refugees' counter-cartography does, can help to move forward the refugees' demands for justice.

Palabras claveAlgo raramente discutido en el conflicto israeli-palestino es el antagonismo que existe entre la dirigencia palestina y los refugiados. Con la instalacion del proceso de paz de Oslo en los 1990, ese antagonismo se hizo cada vez mas agudo porque la supuesta clave del proceso fue que quienes lo lideraban desecharian el derecho de los refugiados a regresar a su lugar de origen, de modo que Israel seria preservado como estado de mayoria judia a cambio de la soberania de la dirigencia palestina sobre el Banco Oeste y la Franja de Gaza. Debido a que con el regreso a su hogar de los refugiados se romperia el balance demografico de un estado de mayoria judia, aquellos se han convertido en guarismos imposibles tanto para Israel como para el marco politico de la dirigencia palestina, imposibilidad que es sobreentendida en los mapas de dominio de Palestina/Israel. Este articulo destaca algunas de las maneras como los refugiados han rehusado este borron, mapeando sobre el terreno su presencia historica. Tomando el uso que le dan a Google Earth como un caso de estudio, se comienza entregando los antecedentes de Google Earth, situando la prehistoria del software dentro de las batallas de vigilancia y control de la Guerra Fria. Luego se hace referencia a algunos cracks con los que la introduccion de Google Earth ha dotado a la escena politica de la pos-Guerra Fria: o sea, que los estados-nacion estan hoy acudiendo a todos los medios para controlar con quien compartir o no los mapas, quien puede producirlos, y como luciran esos mapas. Luego se procede a mostrar como han sacado ventaja los refugiados de la incapacidad del estado de Israel (lo mismo que la dirigencia palestina) para controlar el mapa, proceso en el cual han convertido la geored en un nuevo campo de batalla del conflicto. Concluyo con un analisis sobre como puede ayudar el hecho de sacar cartograficamente a la palestra la politica de fundaciones de Israel y la violencia perpetua, como lo hace la contra-cartografia de los refugiados palestinos, para sacar avante las demandas por justicia de los refugiados.	10.1080/00045608.2014.892328	WOS:000335119400003	2014	Art of War, Art of Resistance
207	Geographic information systems (GIS) represent more than a tool for spatial data handling. Qualitative and mixed-methods approaches with GIS value the suite of spatial methods and technologies, while typically showing a marked sensitivity toward issues of subjectivity, knowledge production, exclusion, reflexivity, and power relations. Although recent research in the use of qualitative GIS demonstrates the ways in which spatial representations and analyses can be used as part of critical geographic inquiry, there remain significant opportunities to demonstrate and synthesize the particular affordances of these approaches. Alongside broader developments in public scholarship and the digital humanities, mixed-methods research with GIS is coming of age, as technological innovations are easing access to data and access to visualization and analytical tools for some. The implications of these developments at the level of knowledge construction within community-based, critical research have been underexplored, however. What are the specific affordances of mixed-methods research with GIS? How are mixed-methods knowledges made and worked through community engagement? Here, we trace how qualitative GIS methods uniquely enable multiple narratives to change the ways in which GIS is practiced. To illustrate this process, we present findings from the use of qualitative GIS to study urban gardening in a postindustrial, Midwestern city.

Palabras claveLos sistemas de informacion geografica (SIG) son algo mas que una herramienta para el manejo de datos espaciales. Las aplicaciones de SIG con metodos cualitativos y mixtos valoran la suite de metodos y tecnologias espaciales, al tiempo que muestran tipicamente una marcada sensibilidad hacia cuestiones de subjetividad, produccion de conocimiento, exclusion, reflexion y relaciones de poder. Si bien la investigacion reciente sobre el uso de los SIG cualitativos demuestra las maneras como pueden utilizarse las representaciones y analisis espaciales como parte de la indagacion geografica critica, todavia hay oportunidades significativas para demostrar y sintetizar la factibilidad particular de estos enfoques. Junto a los mas amplios desarrollos en sabiduria publica y las humanidades digitales, la investigacion de metodos mixtos con SIG esta llegando a ser una realidad, a medida que las innovaciones tecnologicas estan facilitando a algunos el acceso a datos y el acceso a herramientas analiticas y de visualizacion.

208	Wild primates face significant challenges associated with locating resources that involve learning through exploration, encoding, and recalling travel routes, orienting to single landmarks or landmark arrays, monitoring food availability, and applying spatial strategies that reduce effort and increase efficiency. These foraging decisions are likely to involve tradeoffs between traveling to nearby or distant feeding sites based on expectations of resource productivity, predation risk, the availability of other nearby feeding sites, and individual requirements associated with nutrient balancing. Socioecological factors that affect primate foraging decisions include feeding competition, intergroup encounters, mate defense, and opportunities for food sharing. The nine research papers in this Special Issue, Primate Spatial Strategies and Cognition, address a series of related questions examining how monkeys, apes, and humans encode, internally represent, and integrate spatial, temporal, and quantity information in efficiently locating and relocating productive feeding sites in both small-scale and large-scale space. The authors use a range of methods and approaches to study wild and captive primates, including computer and mathematical modeling, virtual reality, and detailed examinations of animal movement using GPS and GIS analyses to better understand primate cognitive ecology and species differences in decision-making. We conclude this Introduction by identifying a series of critical questions for future research designed to document species-specific differences in primate spatial cognition. Am. J.

209	Geographers interested in the social and political implications of the geoweb have recently turned their attention to its attendant \\knowledge politics\\". Such work looks at the processes and discrete moments in development that led to certain knowledges being represented and other knowledges remaining invisible. In this paper I build on these conversations by exploring the knowledge politics of digital humanitarianism. Digital humanitarianism, a technological corollary to the geoweb, is the set of social and institutional networks, technologies, and practices that enable large numbers of remote and on-the-ground individuals to collaborate on humanitarian projects. Specifically, in this paper I offer 4 \\"moments of closure\\" when knowledge politics have been negotiated, enacted, and made durable in digital humanitarianism. These moments of closure constellate around the themes of inclusion, categorization, accuracy, and visibility. I then consider the implications of these moments for the kinds of epistemologies digital humanitarianism espouses, and how knowledges come to be represented. I argue that these knowledge politics - the struggles for legitimacy and means of representation - are fluid and contested, yet become more stable when implemented through technology. Through these processes digital humanitarianism, and by extension the geoweb, embodies the social relations that first produced the debates around knowledge representation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

210	Climate change scenarios predict an increase in the frequency of heavy rainfall events in some areas. This will increase runoff and soil erosion, and reduce agricultural productivity, particularly on vulnerable mountainous agricultural lands that is already exhibiting high rates of soil erosion. Haphazard implementation of soil and water conservation (SWC) interventions on scattered fields is inefficient in reducing soil erosion. The objective of this study was to identify areas at high risk of erosion to aid the design and implementation of sustainable SWC using GIS analysis and farmers' participation approach. A 25 m digital elevation model (DEM) was used to derive layers of flow accumulation, slope steepness and land curvature, which were used to derive an erosion-risk (priority) map for the whole watershed. Boundaries of farmers' fields were mapped and verified by the community and each field was classified into high, moderate or low erosion risk. Fields with low flow accumulation (top of hill) and/or steep slope and/or convex slope were assigned high erosion risk and therefore high implementation priority. The study showed that more than 64% of the fields were classified into high erosion risk areas. Accordingly, a community-watershed plan was established, revised and approved by the community. Incentive loans to implement SWC measures were distributed to 100 farmers based on the priorities of their fields. Judged by local farmers and using 16 randomly selected fields, 90% of the targeted areas were correctly identified using the erosion risk map. After two years, the conservation measures had led to marked improvement of soil conservation. The approach is simple and easy to comprehend by the community and provides scientific basis to prioritize the implementation of SWC and to target the most degraded areas, which amplify the impact of these in reducing the vulnerability to land degradation.	10.1007/s11629-013-2827-x	WOS:000336319100019	2014	A participatory GIS approach to identify critical land degradation areas and prioritize soil conservation for mountainous olive groves (case study)
211	In this paper, I review the recent emergence of three groups of data sources and assess some of the opportunities and challenges they pose for the understanding of cities, particularly in the context of the Regional Science and urban research agenda. These are data collected from mobile sensors carried by individuals, data derived from businesses moving their activity online and government data released in an open format. Although very different from each other, they are all becoming available as a side-effect since they were created with different purposes but their degree of popularity, pervasiveness and ease of access is turning them into interesting alternatives for researchers. Existing projects and initiatives that conform to each class are featured as illustrative examples of these new potential sources of knowledge. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

212	Modeling and mapping of cultural ecosystem services (CES) represents a significant gap in ecosystem service research. A GIS-based methodological framework was developed and applied to map agricultural heritage (AH), understood as a non-divisible combination of three cultural services (dimensions, D): the heritage value associated to a culturally significant species (i.e. Chiloe native potato) (D1); the traditional systems of knowledge of AH keepers (D2); and the social relations among them (D3). The final aim of the study was to provide indicators of the \\final\\" service (AH(i), measured in a 0-100 point scale) and its benefits (AH(B), measured in US$/ha), capable to display areas where high value farmland was located. In essence, AH(i) comprised a set of biocultural variables validated and weighted by expert opinion. The experts gave the maximum importance to 5 variables: number of native potato varieties cultivated (D1), use of own seed (D1), form in which cultivation knowledge was acquired by the keeper (D2), exchange of own seed (03), and number of other potato keepers known (D3). In turn, AH(B) reflected society's willingness to pay for the norimaterial benefits of AH conservation. Since these benefits \\"propagate\\" across space extending from local to unknown and distant beneficiaries, and the aim was to identify the most valuable areas for their capacity to satisfy a potential demand,AH(B) was spatialized following the approach of \\"ascribing\\" the potential benefits to their \\"point of provision\\". Thus the highest values of AH(i) coincided with the highest values of AH(B) (US$10.64-8.64 ha(-1)) a comprised 5608 ha of the landscape, and similarly the lowest values of AH(i) matched the lowest values of AH(B) (US$1.69-0.18 ha(-1)) comprising 13,070 ha of the landscape.

213	Collaborative engagement with local residents and organizations is often cited as one of the most valuable aspects of community-based research integration in classroom settings. However, little has been written on the impact of community engagement in international study abroad programs. We explore the use of community geography in Belize to develop international, community-based research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students. In our study abroad program, students utilize Geographic Information Systems, Global Positioning Systems data collection, fieldwork, and interviews to understand social and environmental issues important to our Belizean collaborators. As we demonstrate in this article, foreign collaborators often have different expectations, commitments, burdens, and resources that either encourage or limit their participation in all stages of the research process. These conflicts present researchers and educators with a significant challenge to identify the appropriate model for community engagement that works best in the particular international context. With these challenges in mind, we examine a community geography model for study abroad programs that has implications for geography and related disciplines as scholars work to create meaningful and sustainable international research experiences that benefit higher education students as well as community residents and organizations in host countries.	10.1080/03098265.2014.908351	WOS:000335198500005	2014	Community geography as a model for international research experiences in study abroad programs
214	Mental and sketch maps have a long tradition in modern geography. Little theoretical and methodological distinction has been made, however, between different hand mapping approaches. Mental maps emerged from behavioral geography of the spatial science tradition as a technique to understand human behaviors based on peoples' perceptions of their spatial environment. More recently, sketch maps have been used in participatory and qualitative geographic information systems (QGIS) to develop cartographies of group and individual spatial narratives. They are a tool that helps achieve QGIS's objectives of collecting unique spatial data of individual experiences, visualizing socio-spatial processes, breaking down particular barriers of positionality in research, and developing new uses of GIS. Two case studies illustrate the use of sketch maps in research, including a project examining job accessibility among working poor individuals and a study of the experiences of fear and safety in public spaces among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community members. Sketch maps in QGIS have many methodological merits. They add an invaluable dimension to the qualitative interview process, offer countermapping perspectives, generate detailed spatial information of individuals, and facilitate data interpretation. ????????????????????????????????, ?????????????????????????????????, ?????????????, ?????????????, ??????????????

Los mapas mentales surgieron en la geografia conductual de la tradicion espacial cientifica como una tecnica para entender las conductas humanas a partir de las percepciones que la gente tiene de su entorno espacial. Mas recientemente, los bocetos cartograficos se han usado en sistemas de informacion geografica cualitativa (SIGC) de tipo participativo, para desarrollar cartografias de narrativas espaciales grupales e individuales. Estas cartografias son una herramienta de apoyo a los objetivos de los SIGC de recolectar datos espaciales unicos a partir de experiencias individuales, visualizando procesos socio-espaciales, echando abajo barreras particulares de posicionalidad en investigacion y desarrollando nuevos usos para los SIG. El uso de las cartografias de boceto en investigacion se ilustra con dos estudios de caso, que incluyen un proyecto para examinar la accesibilidad al trabajo entre trabajadores pobres, y un estudio de las experiencias de temor y seguridad en los espacios publicos entre miembros de las comunidades de lesbianas, gays, bisexuales y transexuales. Los mapas de boceto en los SIGC tienen muchos meritos metodologicos.

215	Detailed maps, appropriate for decision making at the local level are outdated or currently not available in Mozambique. The community map presented in this paper is built on participatory mapping and Participatory GIS practices (especially photo mapping) and links to advanced spatial analysis in the context of disaster risk reduction and flood hazard assessment. Based on a very high-resolution satellite imagery, community members mapped different features such as the community boundary, settlement areas and their names, agricultural areas, important infrastructure and most importantly 'low' and 'high risk' zones for floods. It has been for the first time that a community was mapped in Mozambique in such a way integrating local knowledge. The identification of hazard zones in a participatory manner was seen as one way to overcome the bottleneck of limited available data for a proper GIS-based hazard modeling. Next to the digitization of the community mapped features, an image classification on land use, settlement areas (houses), and the integration of GPS collected points (infrastructure, photos) was carried out. In a final step the map was printed and handed-over to the community members. In the applied methodology it has been demonstrated that the assessment of risks through the integration of community knowledge and paper-based satellite images is valid. Next to the result of deriving a community-based hazard map, the process of mapping is understood as essential to sensitize and learn about local flood hazard risk.	10.1080/17445647.2014.891265	WOS:000334117400011	2014	Participatory mapping of flood hazard risk in Munamicua, District of Buzi, Mozambique
216	Studies of food deserts', neighborhoods in which healthy food is expensive and/or difficult to find, have received much recent political attention. These studies reflect the popularity of a social ecology in public health, rising concerns over an obesity epidemic', and the increasing ease of spatial analysis using geographic information systems (GIS). This paper critically examines these areas, arguing that work on food deserts is a spatialized form of neoliberal paternalism that bounds health problems within low-income communities. Alternative analyses of the urban food landscape, based on work in political ecology and critical GIS, may suggest more equitable paths forward.	10.1177/0309132513484378	WOS:000332616600004	2014	Food deserts
217	Malaria elimination remains a major public health challenge in many tropical regions, including large areas of northern South America. In this study, we present a new high spatial resolution (90 x 90 m) risk map for Colombia and surrounding areas based on environmental and human population data. The map was created through a participatory multi-criteria decision analysis in which expert opinion was solicited to determine key environmental and population risk factors, different fuzzy functions to standardize risk factor inputs, and variable factor weights to combine risk factors in a geographic information system. The new risk map was compared to a map of malaria cases in which cases were aggregated to the municipio (municipality) level. The relationship between mean municipio risk scores and total cases by muncipio showed a weak correlation. However, the relationship between pixel-level risk scores and vector occurrence points for two dominant vector species, Anopheles albimanus and Anopheles darlingi, was significantly different (p < 0.05) from a random point distribution, as was a pooled point distribution for these two vector species and Anopheles nuneztovari. Thus, we conclude that the new risk map based on expert opinion provides an accurate spatial representation of risk of potential vector exposure rather than malaria transmission as shown by the pattern of malaria cases, and therefore it may be used to inform public health authorities as to where vector control measures should be prioritized to limit human-vector contact in future malaria outbreaks.

218	Two common approaches for collecting spatial information through public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) include small-group workshops and broader-scale, household sampling. We evaluate the two approaches using empirical PPGIS data for the Chugach National Forest planning process where both approaches were implemented in spring of 2012. Results from a larger PPGIS survey completed in 1998 were also included in the study for comparison. We examined the spatial concurrence of the data generated by the two approaches (workshop versus survey) on multiple spatial attributes (landscape values) using three analytical methods-subsampling, resampling, and hotspot analysis. We found little to weak spatial association from the two participatory mapping methods on most landscape values. These results may be attributed to less spatial data for the workshops and to differences in measurement and sampling between the two approaches. The empirical results of low spatial concurrence raise important questions about the use of workshop participatory GIS for planning decision support. We discuss the implications and supporting rationale for using participatory mapping in community meetings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

219	Geographers have argued that the emergence of the geospatial web, or geoweb, represents a radical shift away from the state's monopolization of geospatial technologies. Like the public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) movement before it, the geoweb research agenda has emphasized a desire for empowerment and participatory democracy. However, this research agenda has also inherited a conceptualization of power that emphasizes the linkages between empowerment and public visibility, and this paper argues that this inheritance opens potentially sensitive geoweb data to exploitation. Geographers therefore have an important role to play in emphasizing the need to explore ways of harnessing the power of the geoweb for marginalized communities while nonetheless maintaining those communities' privacy. This paper uses work with the Maijuna indigenous people of Peru as a case study to begin a discussion about how the political goals of disempowered people may be best obtained through both public and private uses of the geoweb.	10.1111/anti.12056	WOS:000331247200013	2014	Subaltern Empowerment in the Geoweb
220	This article is based on comparative anthropological fieldwork conducted in the Alpine region of Switzerland on sustainable environmental knowledge about natural hazards related to climate change. It examines ways to complement the normative and technological practices of risk management by using local knowledge to improve the resilience of affected communities against climate-related risks. The study shows how agricultural practices and knowledge may contribute to sustainable behavior towards nature and the environment. It explores how local environmental knowledge, perceptions, and handling strategies of climate-related risks may be integrated within a renewed concept of environmental sustainability. Participatory GIS mapping (PGIS) is the primary research method used. Based on applied visual anthropological methods, PGIS is a cartographical approach that integrates local perceptions and strategies of action drawn from interviews and participant observation. This approach enables improved communication of local knowledge and contributes to interdisciplinary cooperation between different academic fields, such as social anthropology, geography, and civil-engineering in the context of technological risk management. The approach encourages the active participation of local people in the process of sustainable risk management through the integration of cultural meanings and local knowledge about the sustainable management of sensitive natural environments.	10.1007/s13753-014-0013-6	WOS:000353357400005	2014	Participatory Mapping of Local Disaster Risk Reduction Knowledge
221	The goal of this second report is to review how social media are changing the way we collectively map the world. To reach this goal I review different collective mapping practices that characterize the social media era. First I examine the situation of community mapping in the context of new cartographic processes and technologies, with a focus on indigenous cartographies. I then review the use of volunteers in the production and representation of geospatial knowledge, with an emphasis on crisis mapping. Finally, I discuss how map-making in the social media era reflects major trends in terms of power relationships that occur between the state, its citizens and the private sector. These trends reveal the replacement of the state as the main reference for the collection and dissemination of cartographic data, by a combination of private interest and individually volunteered contributions. Just as the specific interests of the nation state have largely helped to shape the reality produced by paper maps throughout the centuries, this new convergence of interests is now helping to shape the reality produced by digital maps through geosocial media.	10.1177/0309132513514005	WOS:000331379700009	2014	Cartography II
222	Land use and cover change (LUCC) is among the most important factors affecting ecosystem services. This study examines the influence of LUCC on recreation and ecotourism opportunities over three decades in southern Chile. An in-depth analysis of the transition matrix was conducted based on Landsat images from 1976, 1985, 1999 and 2007. Main LUCC trajectories were linked to two ecosystem service indicators: (i) Recreation and ecotourism potential, measured in a 0- 100 point scale; and (ii) Recreation and ecotourism opportunities, measured in visitors/ha. A total of 900 trajectories occurred in the landscape between 1976 and 2007. The most important trajectories in terms of area, were the recent degradation of old-growth to secondary forest between 1999 and 2007 (23,290 ha; 13.5 % of landscape), and the early clearing of shrublands for agriculture and pasture land between 1976 and 1985 (7,187 ha, 4.2 % of landscape). In turn, the single most influential trajectory on the magnitude of the indicators was early and permanent degradation of old-growth forest to secondary forest. As a result of these landscape changes, recreation and ecotourism opportunities for the entire landscape were reduced from 65,050 persons in 1976 to 25,038 persons in 1985, further declining to 22,346 and 21,608 persons in 1999 and 2007, respectively. This decrease resulted from changes in specific attributes (i.e. emblematic flora and fauna and forest structure) that were affected by forest degradation and fragmentation. These results highlight the substantial impact of LUCC on recreation opportunity decline, which mirrors biodiversity losses in the study area.	10.1007/s10980-013-9958-x	WOS:000331935100011	2014	Land use change and ecosystem services provision
223	The number of public participation GIS (PPGIS) applications to inform local and regional land, use planning has increased significantly over the last decade. An important rationale for undertaking, participatory mapping is to anticipate and identify areas of potential land use conflict. To date, there, has not been a systematic evaluation of methods for identifying land use conflict potential with PPGIS data. This study uses data from a regional planning study in Australia to describe and evaluate alternative methods for identifying land use conflict potential. A simple, two dimensional model of land use conflict is presented and operationalized with spatial data to provide a heuristic device for regional land-use planning practitioners. Land use conflict is posited to derive from differences in landscape values and land use preferences that can be formulated into different conflict indices and presented in maps. We demonstrate application of the conflict mapping model using residential and industrial development in the region as examples. The spatial distribution of landscape values, values compatibility scoring, land use preference differences, and a combined values and preferences scoring index are all viable methods for identifying and mapping the potential for land use conflict. The preferred method for assessing the potential for land use conflict is one that integrates two dimensions: land use preference directionality (supporting or opposing) and the importance or intensity of landscape values. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each conflict mapping method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

224	Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic bacterial disease of livestock and wildlife, which has major social and economic costs. In Spain, cattle test-and-slaughter schemes have dramatically reduced TB levels, but a wildlife reservoir of the disease is thought to be preventing total eradication. We aim to identify the risk factors for the presence of TB in cattle in Spain. In this case-control study, we combined a farmer-based questionnaire and participatory mapping with government records in Almodovar, Spain. Data were collected from a mixture of TB-free and TB-infected farms, yielding a total sample of 73 farms. Generalised linear modelling and information theory were used to identify the risk factors strongly associated with TB, and farmers were also asked their opinions on TB and wildlife management. The risk factors most strongly associated with TB on a farm were the presence of wildlife, the number of streams per hectare and feeding volume foods (e.g. hay) on the ground. Farmers' opinions about TB were influenced by their experience of the disease and their interactions with wildlife. The results highlight the complexities of managing TB, and demonstrate the need for a system-level understanding of the inter-relationships among epidemiological, ecological, environmental, social and political risk factors.	10.1007/s10344-013-0757-0	WOS:000330589700012	2014	Risk factors for the detected presence of Mycobacterium bovis in cattle in south central Spain
225	Web 2.0 technologies including Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) provide methods for engaging multiple publics in public lands management. We examined the effects of sampling in a PPGIS/VGI application for national forest planning in the US. A random sample (RS) of households and a volunteer public (VP) were invited to participate in an internet-based PPGIS to identify national forest values and use preferences. Spatial and non-spatial group responses were analysed. The VP group expressed stronger utilitarian values and consumptive use preferences while the RS group preferred forest amenities. These results would lead to different planning decisions. PPGIS/VGI methods should include scientific sampling to ground-truth voluntary participation.	10.1080/09640568.2012.741045	WOS:000328600500003	2014	Which 'public'?
226	Concerns have been raised in numerous countries over declining rates of active transport to school. In a UK context, the pupil-school commute is estimated to contribute around 658kilotonnes of CO2 per year; however, tackling this issue effectively requires an improved understanding of how emissions can be modelled and mapped over a variety of scales. This paper implements a new estimation technique for the modelling of CO2 emissions linked with the school commute that integrates both transport network-level routing and geographically disaggregate vehicle emissions data. The model is then applied to a national cohort of pupils in England. Areas demonstrating the highest emissions were typically more rural and/or comprising more affluent resident populations. Emissions were also shown to increase with school year, with larger step changes between educational stages reflecting the different geography of school locations. Furthermore, where secondary school entry policies were selective or based on a religious domination, average emissions were typically higher than in non-selective schools.	10.1080/13658816.2013.832765	WOS:000326562300003	2014	A GIS approach to modelling CO2 emissions associated with the pupil-school commute
227	Abstract Many indigenous communities are at a crossroads as regards lived experience of traditional livelihoods and members with intimate knowledge of their traditional landscapes. Using case studies from two indigenous communities, this article explores the application of both GIS tools and other geographic multimedia in community-based research projects that document landscape-related knowledge. The study involves a First Nation community in British Columbia, Canada and a Sami community in Finnmark County, Norway. We discuss how land-use traditions and related knowledge constitute a peoples' identity and explore digital means of transferring this knowledge to support the ongoing transfer of indigenous knowledge between geographically dispersed community members, as well as future generations.	10.1080/08003831.2014.904619	WOS:000335844100001	2014	Living a Long Way from Home
228	With the cultural turn in geography, scholars have become more focused on the politics of representation, politics of fieldwork, and politics of the research setting. In human geography, this epistemological shift has been accompanied by a methodological move toward intensive methods at the expense of extensive methods. In this article, I suggest that mixed methods that utilize the strengths of both intensive and extensive methods can offset the weaknesses of each method. Moreover, results from the field suggest that the combination of intensive and extensive methods could produce unique insights only possible from a mixed method approach.	10.1080/00330124.2013.768141	WOS:000329154700017	2014	The Potential for Mixed Methods
229	The term neogeography, which designates the proliferation of Web-based geographic information technologies and the parallel opening up of the mapping enterprise to nonexpert cartographers, gained traction in 2006. Implicit in the declaration of neogeography, however, is a trivialization of the geographic discipline. Academic geographers, who have never expressed affinity for the label neogeography, have worked to problematize the instrumentalist reductionism of the discipline to data and technics that such a branding presupposes. But as Wilson and Graham (2013b) recently argued, neogeographyor neo, geographyis as much a statement about newness as it is a commentary about the discipline. Geographers' emphasis on the geography part of the neo, geography equation, although warranted, has come at the expense of examining the equally important societal implications of the framing of recent spatial information technologies as always-already new. In this article, I foreground the neo in neo, geography and trace the ways in which the ascribed newness of emergent Web-based spatial media is leveraged in discursive-material practices that enact certain kinds of changes in the world. Drawing on illustrative empirical examples, I demonstrate the ways in which newness (1) acts as a discursive device that depoliticizes spatial media so as to lay the groundwork for their social naturalization; (2) is made recourse to as a means by which certain techno-capitalist actors disavow themselves of responsibility for the societal effects of these technologies; and (3) underwrites the model through which the proliferation and thereby profitability of location-based services is sustained.	10.1080/00045608.2013.846159	WOS:000328247600004	2014	On the Neo in Neogeography
230	Direction relations between spatial objects have been a research focus in different fields like spatial reasoning, spatial query, GIS, CAD/CAM, and AI. A novel model named Radial model is proposed to obtain both quantitative and qualitative direction relations based on the principle of the ray transmitting as a straight line. The framework of the proposed model is composed of reference point, reference, and target object. Theoretically, we group direction relations into three cases (case I: point/point; case II: point/line and point/area; case III: line/line, line/area and area/area) for calculation based on point-set theory. Additionally, we employ the model in calculating direction relations on the vector and raster spatial data model in GIS. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

231	As geospatial information seemingly moves from users' personal computers to 'the cloud', the use of the phrase 'geographic technologies' has increasingly indicated things beyond desktop GIS. With these shifts in the distribution of geospatial data and practices, and the rise of the geoweb as a site of inquiry, new concepts are needed to better understand the conditions of geographic technologies. In this paper I conceptualize one such element of interactivity: connection. Here, I argue that a logic of continuous connectivity underlies the development of digital spatial media and influences the contemporary production of spatial knowledge. For those lives lived that are presumed to be 'always connected', interactions are figured by these connections to digital media. Many of these digital devices (especially mobile ones) become functional only through a series of connections to data and communication networks. For instance, mobile phones are in continuous communication regardless of direct use, 'listening' to cellular towers and analyzing proximity to deliver the best possible connection. From these system-level codes that maintain device connectivity to software-level codes that push and pull data to and from 'the cloud', being always connected is part of a cultural milieu that has diverse implications not only for attention but also for the development of collective, spatial knowledge. Here, I situate the emergence of continuous connectivity in the marketing of handheld computers in the late 1990s, to historicize the importance of connection for understanding geospatial practices.	10.1068/d14112	WOS:000340959000011	2014	Continuous connectivity, handheld computers, and mobile spatial knowledge
232	Data warehouses help to store and analyze large multidimensional datasets and provide enterprise decision support. With an increased availability of spatial data in recent years, several new strategies have been proposed to enable their integration into data warehouses and and perform complex OLAP analysis. Cardinal directions have turned out to be very important qualitative spatial relations due to their numerous applications in spatial way finding, GIS, qualitative spatial reasoning and in domains such as cognitive sciences, AI and robotics. They are frequently used as selection and restriction criteria in spatial queries. In data warehouses, cardinal directions can be used to perform spatial OLAP and feature navigation operations. In this article, we introduce and develop the Objects Interaction Graticule (OIG) approach to query the cardinal direction relations among spatio-temporal objects in data warehouses. First, we apply a tiling strategy that determines the zones belonging to the nine cardinal directions of each spatial object at a particular time and intersects them. This leads to a collection of grids over time called the Objects Interaction Graticule (OIG). For each grid cell, the information about the spatial objects that intersect it is stored in a Objects Interaction Matrix. In the second phase, an interpretation method is applied to these matrices to determine the cardinal direction between the moving objects. The results obtained for each valid instant over the objects' lifetime describe the variation in the objects movement over time. Thisis integrated as a spatio-temporalOLAP operation in a novel moving objects data warehouse (MODW) that provides an extensible framework for supporting complex structured objects. Finally, we define new directional predicates that extend MDX querying and leverage OLAP between moving objects.	10.3233/FI-2014-1040	WOS:000336408000003	2014	Querying Cardinal Directions between Complex Objects in Data Warehouses
233	Over the last years, geospatial web platforms, social media, and volunteered geographic information (VGI) have opened a window of opportunity for traditional Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) to usher in a new era. Taking advantage of these technological achievements, this paper presents a new approach for a citizen-orientated framework of spatial planning that aims at integrating participatory community work into existing decision-making structures. One major cornerstone of the presented approach is the application of a social geoweb platform (the GeoCitizen platform) that combines geo-web technologies and social media in one single tool allowing citizens to collaboratively report observations, discuss ideas, solve, and monitor problems in their living environment at a local level. This paper gives an account of an ongoing participatory land-zoning process in the Capital District of Quito, Ecuador, where the GeoCitizen platform is applied in a long-term study.	10.1080/15230406.2014.890546	WOS:000335968300007	2014	The GeoCitizen-approach
234	How people feel about places matters, especially in their neighborhood. It matters for their health, the health of their children, and their social cohesion and use of local resources. A growing body of research in public health, planning, psychology, and sociology bears out this point. Recently, a new methodological tack has been taken to find out how people feel about places. The sketch map, a once popular tool of behavioral geographers and environmental psychologists to understand how people perceive the structural aspects of places, is now being used in concert with geographic information systems (GIS) to capture and spatially analyze the emotional side of urban environmental perception. This confluence is generating exciting prospects for what we can learn about the characteristics of the urban environment that elicit emotion. However, due to the uncritical way this approach has been employed to date, excitement about the prospects must be tempered by the acknowledgement of its potential problems. In this paper we review the extant research on integrating sketch maps with GIS and then employ a case study of mapping youth fear in Los Angeles gang neighborhoods to demonstrate these prospects and the problems, particularly in the areas of (1) representation of environmental perception in GIS and (2) spatial analysis of these data.	10.1068/b38151	WOS:000334345900004	2014	The prospects and problems of integrating sketch maps with geographic information systems to understand environmental perception
235	Arguably, there have been few shifts in the GISciences so paradigmatic as the emergence of locationally-aware mobile devices. GISc researchers in the US have witnessed these changes in just the last crop of PhD students, with topics on location-based services, the geoweb, volunteered geographic information and neogeography, somewhat eclipsing earlier, trendy topics on web-based GIS and interactive digital cartography. Indeed, there are new important players in GISc, with training in and outside of Geography, with backgrounds as diverse as the engineering/computational sciences and the digital humanities as well as critical human geographies. Mobilities researchers, qualitative GIS scholars, cyberinfrastructural scientists, and social and cultural geographers have configured research programs around the proliferation of locationally-aware devices and the 'big data' that have emerged from them. In this viewpoint, I shall outline these diverse developments and sketch what I argue are the foundational issues that comprise a research agenda with and about geospatial technologies in the location-aware future: technological development, the social life of data, and the everyday practices around mobile digital devices.

236	Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that continues to represent a significant health challenge in many tropical and subtropical regions. At a local scale, dengue prevention and control is a cooperative effort as favorable vector breeding sites may be found across residential, commercial and public spaces within a community. However, many vector control initiatives do not take into account local understanding of dengue risk and how this impacts the actions of residents to prevent dengue by eliminating breeding sources. The objective of this study was to use a participatory mapping approach to identify spatial perceptions of risk to dengue at a community scale. Four mapping groups were formed in two urban Malaysian communities that have experienced high dengue rates, divided into male and female groups to encourage gender equity. Participants were asked to draw a map of areas they associated with dengue and mosquito breeding in their communities, and to describe the important features on the map. Sketch map features were digitized into a GIS to create a georeferenced map of community knowledge, translating the outputs into formats accessible to stakeholders. Community spaces linked to dengue identified in the mapping exercises differed between the two communities, and included green spaces, construction projects, drainage networks and abandoned land areas. The findings indicated that resident perceptions of some vulnerable areas, such as green spaces, differed from the views of local public health staff, and could influence the actions of residents to adequately destroy breeding sites. This highlights the need to understand local knowledge of mosquito breeding in order to enhance co-operative efforts with vector-control workers, and increase the effectiveness of dengue prevention efforts at a local scale in Malaysia.

237	Public participation GIS (PPGIS) methods have progressed over the last decade, but as a rapidly evolving practice and area of research, there are new challenges. To identify the key issues and research priorities in PPGIS, two researchers that have designed and implemented more than 40 empirical studies spanning both environmental and urban applications present their views about the present and future of PPGIS for land use planning and management. This paper is intended to be a synthesis, but not necessarily a consensus of the key issues and research priorities. We have organized the paper into six general key issues and four priority research topics. The key issues are: (1) conceptual and theoretical foundations, (2) the diversity of definitions and approaches to participatory mapping, (3) the spatial attributes measured in participatory mapping, (4) sampling, participation, and data quality, (5) relationships between participatory mapped attributes and physical places, and (6) the integration of PPGIS data into planning decision support. Our top research priorities include: (1) understanding and increasing participation rates, (2) identifying and controlling threats to spatial data quality, (3) improving the \\PP\\" or public participation in PPGIS, and (4) evaluating the effectiveness of PPGIS. Our purpose for presenting a research agenda is to stimulate discourse among PPGIS researchers and practitioners about future research needs and to provide support for the mobilization of resources to undertake future empirical research.

317	There has, historically, been considerable uncertainty over the meaning of 'urban nature' and, therefore, the extent to which culture and nature are bound in the urban setting. We explore, in this paper, the spatiality of everyday nature as experienced by youth in an urban setting. To do so, we draw on the results of a participatory mapping activity that was designed to elicit information about where youth felt most connected to nature while in the city. Using sketch-map survey instruments, we collected hand-drawn responses from forty-three high school students in the downtown core of Tacoma, Washington. Data were digitized and analyzed in a GIS, and results were revealing of the contingency of the 'nature' concept in urban space as well as the centrality of 'loose' space to urban experiences that are evocative of being in nature.	10.1080/14649365.2012.735690	WOS:000311222300002	2012	Sketching culture, sketching nature

238	Subsistence resources are critical for indigenous communities in the Kotzebue Sound region of NW Alaska. Global sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal erosion are likely to create unfavorable and hazardous conditions for coastal and estuarine settlements. It is unclear how SLR and erosion might affect coastal subsistence resources because of highly complex ecological interactions. This study integrates physical, anthropological, and survey data to assess coastal vulnerability and to identify areas of concern for local and regional planning and environmental protection. This study analyzes and integrates historical and projected physical coastal changes within the Kotzebue Sound region with (1) a coastal vulnerability index (CVI); (2) community-based participatory GIS maps of community subsistence resources; and (3) representative surveys of local communities to determine the importance of each type of resource. The results identify Kivalina and Deering as particularly vulnerable coastal locations among four studied villages. While the CVI is high in these locations, low erosion rates will not likely have any negative impact on fish and caribou-two of the most important subsistence resource species for these communities. Because of the higher number of identified subsistence resource species, Deering is more resilient than Kivalina to any potential negative coastal impacts. This methodology can be useful in other coastal areas where subsistence resources play a major part in people's lives.	10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00001.1	WOS:000331020700015	2014	Integrating Coastal Vulnerability and Community-Based Subsistence Resource Mapping in Northwest Alaska
239	Increasing interest in implementing an ecosystem-based management approach has made stakeholder involvement vital and has highlighted the need for an effective participatory framework. In this study we used a participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) framework to collaboratively map the marine resources of the transboundary Grenadine Islands with a broad range of stakeholders from the two sovereign nations. We found the application of PGIS allowed the collective resolution of an appropriate mapping scale and a locally relevant habitat classification scheme that would not only serve the needs of resource managers, but could also be understood by resource users. Furthermore, multi-level stakeholder involvement in the mapping process captured resource use profiles and other fishing-related attributes, gave credibility to local knowledge and ownership of information, and was instrumental in building capacity to access and use the produced information. Lessons learned included the importance of investing considerable time early in the participatory process, which was later rewarded by stakeholder buy-in and led to financial and in-kind support. Furthermore, hosting the information in multiple formats on a project website has resulted in easy access and use by a wide range of stakeholders over a cross-country scale. We believe our experiences will be valuable to other practitioners considering using PGIS, particularly for those working in similar resource-limited, developing nation contexts.	10.1080/08920753.2013.863725	WOS:000330263200003	2014	A Participatory Approach to Marine Habitat Mapping in the Grenadine Islands
240	Despite widespread recognition that social-value information is needed to inform stakeholders and decision makers regarding trade-offs in environmental management, it too often remains absent from ecosystem service assessments. Although quantitative indicators of social values need to be explicitly accounted for in the decision-making process, they need not be monetary. Ongoing efforts to map such values demonstrate how they can also be made spatially explicit and relatable to underlying ecological information. We originally developed Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES) as a tool to assess, map, and quantify nonmarket values perceived by various groups of ecosystem stakeholders. With SolVES 2.0 we have extended the functionality by integrating SolVES with Maxent maximum entropy modeling software to generate more complete social-value maps from available value and preference survey data and to produce more robust models describing the relationship between social values and ecosystems. The current study has two objectives: (1) evaluate how effectively the value index, a quantitative, nonmonetary social-value indicator calculated by SolVES, reproduces results from more common statistical methods of social-survey data analysis and (2) examine how the spatial results produced by SolVES provide additional information that could be used by managers and stakeholders to better understand more complex relationships among stakeholder values, attitudes, and preferences. To achieve these objectives, we applied SolVES to value and preference survey data collected for three national forests, the Pike and San Isabel in Colorado and the Bridger-Teton and the Shoshone in Wyoming. Value index results were generally consistent with results found through more common statistical analyses of the survey data such as frequency, discriminant function, and correlation analyses. In addition, spatial analysis of the social-value maps produced by SolVES provided information that was useful for explaining relationships between stakeholder values and forest uses. Our results suggest that SolVES can effectively reproduce information derived from traditional statistical analyses while adding spatially explicit, social-value information that can contribute to integrated resource assessment, planning, and management of forests and other ecosystems.

241	Previous urban park research has used self-reported surveys and physical activity logs to examine associations between physical activity and park features, size, and distance to participants' homes. In this study, we used participatory geographic information systems (GIS) methods to explore potential correlates of physical activity and other health benefits in urban parks. Using an internet-based public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) system, study participants identified the spatial locations where they engaged in various types of physical activity and where they received other park benefits environmental, social, and psychological health benefits. Using an urban park typology, we found that different urban park types provide different opportunities for physical activity with linear parks providing the greatest overall physical benefit while other park types provided important non-physical community benefits. Distance to park was not a significant predictor of physical activity but park size was correlated with physical activity and other park benefits. We discuss the strengths and limitations of using PPGIS methods for understanding the benefits of urban park systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

242	Landscape values are a type of place value and are identified and mapped using public participation GIS (PPGIS). PPGIS engages nonexperts to identify important spatial information for environmental or natural resource planning. In 1998, we used PPGIS to identify landscape values for the Chugach National Forest (Alaska) plan revision process. In 2012, we conducted a longitudinal study of the same national forest using Internet PPGIS to identify changes in landscape values. The empirical results indicate stability in landscape values both in importance and spatial distribution. However, the use of different PPGIS methods (paper map vs. Internet) in the longitudinal study also introduced challenges in interpreting and explaining the spatial results. We discuss trade-offs in conducting longitudinal PPGIS research using mixed methods. PPGIS appears well suited for public lands planning, and national forest planning in particular, but barriers to use, such as regulatory approval, remain formidable.	10.1080/08941920.2013.840023	WOS:000328811100003	2014	Measuring Change in Place Values for Environmental and Natural Resource Planning Using Public Participation GIS (PPGIS)
243	In this paper we explore the challenges involved in engaging the full range of stakeholders needed for effective marine resource management in the transboundary Grenadine Islands shared by the small island developing States (SIDS) of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada. The study describes the ways stakeholders were engaged in the development of participatory geographic information systems (PGIS), both in terms of the research approach (process) and the final geodatabase (product); it illustrates how the approach provides a practical means to strengthen aspects of marine governance, particularly in a SIDS context. We found that PGIS can provide a foundation for ecosystem-based transboundary marine governance. The advantages of this approach are two-fold: it provides the fullest possible range of information as input for the management of marine resources and it engages the stakeholders. This engagement takes several forms: capacity to participate in research; ownership of information produced; increased stakeholder understanding; empowerment through access to information; capacity to interact with other stakeholders for information and problem-solving; and competence to participate in actual governance processes. Lastly, we discuss considerations for other practitioners contemplating using PGIS, particularly those working in similar resource-limited SIDS environments.	10.1111/1477-8947.12029	WOS:000330131100005	2013	Participatory GIS for strengthening transboundary marine governance in SIDS
244	In 2006 the Western Cape Education Department (WCED) initialised the Language Transformation Plan (LTP) as a strategy to implement the longstanding national Language in Education Policy (DOE 1997). If serious efforts were to be made to expand the transformation plan to all schools across the province, detailed language related information was needed, on various levels of the institution. There is an established use of geographic information systems (GIS) for planning and policy making in fields more traditionally viewed as geographical. Increased accessibility to computer hardware and on-going efforts to create user-friendly software have paved the way for GIS to enter into disciplines such as sociolinguistics in ways that extend beyond simply mapping the distributions of languages in space. This article explores how mapping language-related variables at school level, using GIS, can support language planning and policy implementation from below, by drawing on concepts such as public participation GIS' (NCGIA 1996) and counter-mapping' (Peluso 1995).	10.1080/10228195.2013.840669	WOS:000327929300002	2013	Language mapping for education policy realisation from below
245	Background: While understanding geography's role in healthcare has been an area of research for over 40 years, the application of geography-based analyses to prescription medication use is limited. The body of literature was reviewed to assess the current state of such studies to demonstrate the scale and scope of projects in order to highlight potential research opportunities. Objective: To review systematically how researchers have applied geography-based analyses to medication use data. Methods: Empiric, English language research articles were identified through PubMed and bibliographies. Original research articles were independently reviewed as to the medications or classes studied, data sources, measures of medication exposure, geographic units of analysis, geospatial measures, and statistical approaches. Results: From 145 publications matching key search terms, forty publications met the inclusion criteria. Cardiovascular and psychotropic classes accounted for the largest proportion of studies. Prescription drug claims were the primary source, and medication exposure was frequently captured as period prevalence. Medication exposure was documented across a variety of geopolitical units such as countries, provinces, regions, states, and postal codes. Most results were descriptive and formal statistical modeling capitalizing on geospatial techniques was rare. Conclusion: Despite the extensive research on small area variation analysis in healthcare, there are a limited number of studies that have examined geographic variation in medication use. Clearly, there is opportunity to collaborate with geographers and GIS professionals to harness the power of GIS technologies and to strengthen future medication studies by applying more robust geospatial statistical methods.

246	While local governments have been one of the major user groups of GIS, there is still little research on how GIS development in local government might be intertwined with urban governance, particularly in non-Western contexts. Drawing upon insights from GIS implementation, critical GIS, and governmentality studies, this article seeks to bridge this gap by examining the implications of Chinese urban government GIS practices amidst China's changing urban governance. Through an in-depth case study of Shenzhen, this article analyzes how urban GIS has been transformed from a practice involving internal organizational workflow automation, into a more active dimension of the governance of urban spacesreflected in the expanding practice of geo-coding the urban landscape. Geo-coding here refers to a broadly defined spatial practice of carving and reconstructing a rational urban space. GIS practices have constituted a particular form of geographic rationality that seeks to govern at a distance while simultaneously regulating the urban environment, intersecting with the broader transformations of China's urban governance. These GIS developments have been largely government-centric rather than citizen-centric, yet they provide possibilities for new forms of spatial knowledge production for citizen participation in urban governance.	10.1080/02723638.2013.812389	WOS:000325686200002	2013	Digitizing the Dragon Head, Geo-Coding the Urban Landscape
247	The objective of the current research was to examine the current epidemiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI); to determine the effects of geographic region, co-morbidities, year of injury, injury severity, and demographics on hospital costs, length of stay (LOS), and mortality. All subjects were drawn from the Thomason Reuters MarketScan((R)) database. Statistical methods used included descriptive analysis, bivariate analysis, logistic regression, and the Geographic Information System (GIS) software, ArcMap. We studied 76,313 patients with TBI from 2004 to 2009 (52,721 with commercial insurance and 23,592 with Medicare) from the MarketScan database. As age increased, mortality rate and median LOS increased. The median hospital costs for adults were the highest ($13,000 for ages 18-64) compared with children ($8000 for age 0-14) and elderly persons ($9000 for age 65). The mortality rate for the elderly population has decreased slightly (11.1% in 2004 to 9.9% in 2009 for men, and 7.0% to 6.9% for women); however, their hospital costs have increased significantly ($6899 in 2004 to $11,567 in 2009 for men; $6784 to $9782 for women). Concerning the impact of geography, the western United States (e.g., Washington and California) had lower mortality rates and higher median costs while the southeast United States had the highest mortality and mixed median costs. Both overall mortality and median LOS have remained relatively stable over the years. Hospital cost, however, has increased for the elderly population even after accounting for the inflation. There is significant geographic variation for both mortality and hospital costs.	10.1089/neu.2013.2857	WOS:000325491000008	2013	Trend and Geographic Analysis for Traumatic Brain Injury Mortality and Cost Based on MarketScan Database
248	Background: While there is no panacea for alleviating campus safety concerns, safety experts agree that one of the key components to an effective campus security plan is monitoring the environment. Despite previous attempts to measure campus safety, quantifying perceptions of fear, safety, and risk remains a challenging issue. Since perceptions of safety and incidents of crime do not necessarily mirror one another, both were utilized in this investigation. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to describe an innovative, mixed methods approach for assessing campus safety at a large, urban campus in the southeast region of the United States. Method: A concurrent triangulation design was implemented to allow investigators the opportunity to collect qualitative and quantitative data simultaneously and integrate results in the interpretation phase. Data were collected from four distinct sources of information. Results: Student focus groups yielded data regarding perceptions of risk, and kernel density analysis was used to identify hot spots of campus crime incidents. Conclusion: While in many cases perceived risk and actual crime incidents were associated, incidents of hot spots of each type occurred independently with such frequency that an overall correlation of the two was not significant. Accordingly, while no significant correlation between perceived risk and crime incidents was confirmed statistically, the geospatial integration of these data suggested three types of safety conditions. Further, the combination of focus group data and spatial analyses provided a more comprehensive and, therefore, more complete understanding of the multifaceted issues related to campus safety.	10.1177/0193841X13509815	WOS:000336502600001	2013	A Geospatial Mixed Methods Approach to Assessing Campus Safety
249	The management of multiple-use public lands such as national forests in the U.S. is controversial because of the wide range of potential uses and contested public values for these lands. Previous research on national forest values and management preferences examined these relationships non-spatially. The development of public participation GIS (PPGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI) systems provide new opportunities to assess spatial relationships between perceived national forest values and preferred uses. This research used empirical data collected from a PPGIS/VGI study for three national forests in California to examine spatial and non-spatial relationships between place-based forest values and preferred uses. The relationships suggest public participants translated some of their non-spatial forest values and preferences into behavioral choices when mapping place-specific values and preferred uses. The empirical relationships between place-based forest values and uses were generally consistent with previous survey research results. Positive, non-spatial attitudes toward extractive uses of national forests were correlated with participant mapping of economic values and related extractive uses, while nonmaterial forest attitudes were correlated with participant mapping of amenity values and conservation-related uses. Further, spatial preferences for extractive forest uses such as timber harvesting were mapped proximate to economic values, while nonmaterial spatial preferences were mapped proximate to amenity-related forest values. PPGIS offers the potential to translate philosophical and ideology-based national forest preferences into place-specific discourse about forest management activities where public accommodation may be more achievable.

250	Ecosystem-based planning and management have stimulated the need to gather sociocultural values and human uses of land in formats accessible to diverse planners and researchers. Human Ecology Mapping (HEM) approaches offer promising spatial data gathering and analytical tools, while also addressing important questions about human-landscape connections. This article reviews and compares the characteristics of three HEM approaches that are increasingly used in natural resource management contexts, each focused on a particular aspect of human-environmental interactions. These aspects include tenure and resource use (TRU), local ecological knowledge (LEK), and sense of place (SOP). We discuss their origins, provide examples of their use, and identify challenges to their application. Our review serves as a guide for environmental managers, planners, and communities interested in gathering spatial data on aspects of human ecology important in ecosystem-based management and planning, and for scientists designing socioecological research.	10.1007/s10745-013-9573-0	WOS:000325262500001	2013	Making Sense of Human Ecology Mapping
251	Autism prevalence has risen dramatically over the past two decades in California. Although often suggested to have been crucial to the rise of autism, environmental and social contextual drivers of diagnosis have not been extensively examined. Identifying the spatial patterning of autism cases at birth and at diagnosis can help clarify which contextual drivers are affecting autism's rising prevalence. Children with autism not co-morbid with mental retardation served by the California Department of Developmental Services during the period 1992-2005 were matched to California's Birth Master Files. We search for spatial clusters of autism at time of birth and at time of diagnosis using a spatial scan approach that controls for key individual-level risk factors. We then test whether indicators of neighborhood-level diagnostic resources are associated with the diagnostic clusters and assess the extent of clustering by autism symptom severity through a multivariate scan. Finally, we test whether children who move into neighborhoods with higher levels of resources are more likely to receive an autism diagnosis relative to those who do not move with regard to resources. Significant birth and diagnostic clusters of autism are observed independent of key individual-level risk factors. While the clusters overlap, there is a strong positive association between the diagnostic clusters and neighborhood-level diagnostic resources. In addition, children with autism who are higher functioning are more likely to be diagnosed within a cluster than children with autism who are lower functioning. Most importantly, children who move into a neighborhood with more diagnostic resources than their previous residence are more likely to subsequently receive an autism diagnosis than children whose neighborhood resources do not change. We identify birth and diagnostic clusters of autism in California that are independent of individual-level autism risk factors. Our findings implicate a causal relationship between neighborhood-level diagnostic resources and spatial patterns of autism incidence but do not rule out the possibility that environmental toxicants have also contributed to autism risk.

257	Many communities are challenged with balancing growing demands for energy and residential development with the protection of places having cultural or biological importance. Incorporating the preferences and values of local residents early in decision-making processes through public participation GIS (PPGIS) data may help to limit land use conflicts. We used a PPGIS dataset from three counties in Wyoming to determine 1) if there are spatial relationships among mapped cultural or biological values and preferences for new energy or residential development that indicate compatibility or conflict and 2) if there is evidence of geographic discounting or a not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) pattern associated with development preferences. We found strong overlap, or compatibility, between mapped cultural and biological values and little or no overlap among mapped biological or cultural values and energy development siting preferences. These relationships could identify opportunities for conservation initiatives and inform siting of new developments. Where people live influenced their mapping patterns. Participants mapped perceived positive environmental conditions closer to home than negative conditions, demonstrating geographic discounting. We observed NIMBYism for wind development, as participants mapped wind preferences further from their homes than where development is anticipated. We also observed NIMBYism for residential development, but at a reduced spatial discounting rate compared to wind development. Participants mapped their preferences for oil and gas development further from home than existing or anticipated wells but tended to place them near a large oil and gas field, which may reflect a preference for concentrated development, rather than NIMBYism. We noted distinct preferences for contrasting values in different locations, and this consistency among participants shows that PPGIS datasets have potential to communicate a useful collective vision to inform development siting.

252	New spatial media - the informational artefacts and mediating technologies of the geoweb - represent new opportunities for activist, civic, grassroots, indigenous and other groups to leverage web-based geographic information technologies in their efforts to effect social change. Drawing upon evidence from an inductive analysis of five online initiatives that engage new spatial media in activism and civic engagement, we explore new dimensions of the knowledge politics advanced through new spatial media and the mechanisms through which they emerge. Knowledge politics' refers to the use of particular information content, forms of representation or ways of analysing and manipulating information to try to establish the authority or legitimacy of knowledge claims. The five new spatial media initiatives we analyse here introduce new dimensions to the modes of collecting, validating and representing information, when considered against practices of many activist/civic encounters with other kinds of geographic information technologies, such as GIS. The significance of these practices is not in their (arguable) newness, but rather their role in advancing different epistemological strategies for establishing the legitimacy and authority of knowledge claims. Specifically, these new knowledge politics entail a deployment of geovisual artefacts to structure a visual experience; a prioritisation of individualised interactive/exploratory ways of knowing; hyper-granular, highly immediate, experiential cartographic representations de-coupled from conventional practices of cartographic abstraction; and approaches to asserting credibility through witnessing, peer verification and transparency.	10.1111/j.1475-5661.2012.00543.x	WOS:000324026800003	2013	New spatial media, new knowledge politics
253	Background The NHS has a target of cutting its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Travel comprises 17% of the NHS carbon footprint. This carbon footprint represents the total CO2 emissions caused directly or indirectly by the NHS. Patient journeys have previously been planned largely without regard to the environmental impact. The potential contribution of 'avoidable' journeys in primary care is significant. Aim To investigate the carbon footprint of patients travelling to and from a general practice surgery, the issues involved, and potential solutions for reducing patient travel. Design and setting A mixed methods study in a medium-sized practice in Yorkshire. Method During March 2012, 306 patients completed a travel survey. GIS maps of patients' travel (modes and distances) were produced. Two focus groups (12 clinical and 13 non-clinical staff) were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using a thematic framework approach. Results The majority (61%) of patient journeys to and from the surgery were made by car or taxi; main reasons cited were 'convenience', 'time saving', and 'no alternative' for accessing the surgery. Using distances calculated via ArcGIS, the annual estimated CO2 equivalent carbon emissions for the practice totalled approximately 63 tonnes. Predominant themes from interviews related to issues with systems for booking appointments and repeat prescriptions; alternative travel modes; delivering health care; and solutions to reducing travel. Conclusion The modes and distances of patient travel can be accurately determined and allow appropriate carbon emission calculations for GP practices. Although challenging, there is scope for identifying potential solutions (for example, modifying administration systems and promoting walking) to reduce ` 'avoidable' journeys and cut carbon emissions while maintaining access to health care.	10.3399/bjgp13X671579	WOS:000325529200001	2013	Carbon footprint of patient journeys through primary care
254	Qualitative locations describe the locations of spatial objects by relating them to a reference frame with qualitative relations. Existing models concerned with regional partitions are mainly topology-based and do not consider the effects of scale changes on locations. This study develops a direction-based multi-scale qualitative location (DMQL) model to fill this gap. First, a cell partition is defined by extending the borders of the minimum bounding rectangles of the regions in a regional partition. Relating spatial objects to all regions by a set of directions is equal to representing the objects as a set of cells in a cell partition. Second, due to the multiple cell representations of spatial objects and the changes in direction relations across scales, some approaches are presented to derive the direction changes between regions in different frames, between spatial objects and regions, and between spatial objects at different scales. Third, the location and relation consistencies of qualitative locations are evaluated based on the cell representations of spatial objects at multiple scales through a case study. The results indicate that the DMQL model can locate objects more precisely than the topology-based models. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

255	Shape cognition and representation play an important role in spatial analysis because shape contains some characteristics of geographic phenomena that can be mined to discover hidden geographic principles. As a difficult cognition problem, the shape representation problem in GIS field has the properties of abstraction, indetermination and symbolization. How to use a model to represent shape cognition in our mental world and how to use a single number to compute the shape measure are interesting questions. In the image processing domain, there are many shape measure methods, but there are few proposals for corresponding vector data. This study aims to build a polygon shape measure and offers a Fourier transform-based method to compute the degree of shape similarity. The procedure first represents the boundary of the vector polygon shape as a periodic function, which is expanded in a Fourier descriptor series, and then, it obtains a set of coefficients that capture the shape information. Through the experiment on spatial shape match and shape query, the study shows that Fourier transform-based shape identification and template matching is consistent with human cognition.

256	The purpose of this study is to offer new insight into architectural and urban planning in the post-sedentary age. Specifically, we reveal the characteristics of walking in cities with mobile networks. The experiment involved strolling around the old town of Tokyo with 20 participants divided into two groups: (1) Those who could use smartphones and (2) those who could only use printed maps. The participants' behaviors were recorded by GPS data loggers and analyzed by GIS in terms of the following three aspects. First, we estimated the features of walking according to the lengths of time participants collected information and the contents of that information and reached the conclusion that walking within mobile networks was deliberate. Second, we analyzed the efficiency of walking using the redundancy index and concluded that different kinds of behaviors can be confirmed depending on the time available to complete tasks. Third, we explored walking with curiosity in terms of the various types of roads where participants walked and inferred that walking in a mobile network environment reduced anxiety regarding losing one's way and aroused much curiosity.

258	Geographic information system (GIS) or Health geography is a geographical identification of the spatial variation of contagion disease and zoonosis risk in certain conditions. Comparing the variation of environmental contamination of Toxocara spp. sands of lawns and public areas through the Geographic Information System. Were investigated 98% of Parana recreational urban areas such as, schools, public parks and squares filled with sand and/or lawn. Samples were analyzed using zinc sulphate solution centrifuge-flotation, density 1.420, and water sedimentation. Maps were developed by ESRI Arc GIS 9.2. Total 77/98 (78,6%) of public spaces shown Toxocara spp. eggs presence. No significant difference was observed (p = 0,9999) between eggs prevalence in sand 44/56 (78,6%), and lawn 33/42 (78,6%), at school (p = 0,6898) and squares (p = 0,0616). Egg contamination prevailed in periphery areas in the sand 20/27 (74%) and lawn 18/21 (86%). However, no significant difference was observed between sand and lawn contamination from schools and parks to central and peripheral areas. Although schools 62/66 (93,9%) presented a higher number of enclosed spaces, did not provide a lower frequency of pollution (p = 0,3327). GIS observed a scattered pattern of zoonosis among schools and public squares sand and lawns, with predominance of contamination in the peripheral areas with presence of dogs/cats.	10.2478/s11686-013-0142-x	WOS:000323651800012	2013	Identification of public areas with potential toxocariasis transmission risk using Geographical Information Systems
259	In many developing countries, political documentation acknowledges the crucial elements of participation and spatiality for effective land use planning. However, operative approaches to spatial data inclusion and representation in participatory land management are often lacking. In this paper, we apply and develop an integrated landscape characterization approach to enhance spatial knowledge generation about the complex human-nature interactions in landscapes in the context of Zanzibar, Tanzania. We apply an integrated landscape conceptualization as a theoretical framework where the expert and local knowledge can meet in spatial context. The characterization is based on combining multiple data sources in GIS, and involves local communities and their local spatial knowledge since the beginning into the process. Focusing on the expected information needs for community forest management, our characterization integrates physical landscape features and retrospective landscape change data with place-specific community knowledge collected through participatory GIS techniques. The characterization is established in a map form consisting of four themes and their synthesis. The characterization maps are designed to support intuitive interpretation, express the inherently uncertain nature of the data, and accompanied by photographs to enhance communication. Visual interpretation of the characterization mediates information about the character of areas and places in the studied local landscape, depicting the role of forest resources as part of the landscape entity. We conclude that landscape characterization applied in GIS is a highly potential tool for participatory land and resource management, where spatial argumentation, stakeholder communication, and empowerment are critical issues.	10.1007/s00267-013-0121-x	WOS:000323661700011	2013	Landscape Characterization Integrating Expert and Local Spatial Knowledge of Land and Forest Resources
260	Objective To examine the role of accessibility, product availability, promotions and social norms promotion, factors contributing to the use of smokeless tobacco (ST) products in a typical low-income community of Mumbai community using Geographic Information System (GIS), observational and interview methodologies and to assess implementation of Cigatettes and other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) legislation. Rationale In India, the third largest producer of tobacco in the world, smokeless tobacco products are used by men, women and children. New forms of highly addictive packaged smokeless tobacco products such as gutkha are inexpensive and rates of use are higher in low-income urban communities. These products are known to increase rates of oral cancer and to affect reproductive health and fetal development. Methods The study used a mixed methods approach combining ethnographic and GIS mapping, observation and key informant interviews. Accessibility was defined as density, clustering and distance of residents and schools to tobacco outlets. Observation and interview data with shop owners and community residents produced an archive of products, information on shop histories and income and normative statements. Results Spatial analysis showed high density of outlets with variations across subcommunities. All residents can reach tobacco outlets within 30-100 feet of their homes. Normative statements from 55 respondents indicate acceptance of men's, women's and children's use, and selling smokeless tobacco is reported to be an important form of income generation for some households. Multilevel tobacco control and prevention strategies including tobacco education, community norms change, licensing and surveillance and alternative income generation strategies are needed to reduce accessibility and availability of smokeless tobacco use.	10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2011-050148	WOS:000323166400010	2013	Availability, accessibility and promotion of smokeless tobacco in a low-income area of Mumbai
261	Considerable effort has been directed into separate but related research foci the study of ecosystem services and participatory mapping methods. The two research foci intersect in the mapping of place-based values, an operational form of social values for ecosystem services that uses public participation GIS (PPGIS) methods. The social valuation of ecosystem services through participatory mapping offers an alternative valuation approach to economic valuation of ecosystem services. This study analyzes the spatial associations between global land cover which provides a proxy indicator of ecosystem services, and place-based values from 11 PPGIS studies completed in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand that comprise a diverse set of temperate ecoregions. Key findings include: the highest frequencies of social values for ecosystem services were associated with forested land cover; water bodies were highly valuable relative to area occupied; and agricultural land and areas of permanent snow and ice were least valuable. Most land cover classes demonstrated high diversity of social values. The importance of different land cover types varies based on the selected evaluation criteria. Additional research is needed to determine whether economic and social valuation approaches provide complementary, contradictory, or redundant measures of the importance of landscapes for providing ecosystem services.

262	Forest landscape planning analyses all forest aspects (economic, ecological and social) and defines long-term forest management guidelines. Various actors are involved in landscape planning; therefore the analysis needs to take into account goals and targets of the different stakeholders. The participatory process can strongly support the development of a bottom-up forest plan definition when stakeholders are involved throughout the decision-making process. In this way, management guidelines are defined by decision makers and local communities through a shared process. With this approach, Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) is a useful tool to support the decision-making process in forest planning. The aim of the paper is to present a method that matches these requirements by exploiting the potential of GIS. The application of Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) is a useful support to integrate stakeholders' priorities and expectations into forest planning strategies. Furthermore, it represents the starting point to draw up management scenarios by integrating and comparing both technical and social priorities. This paper presents an application of PPGIS in a forest landscape plan in southern Italy (Alto Agri district, Basilicata region).	10.3832/ifor0917-006	WOS:000327764500004	2013	Public participation GIS to support a bottom-up approach in forest landscape planning
264	Researchers have traditionally used participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) projects to inject indigenous voices into the political sphere as they work for various legal rights. Due to their participatory nature, however, these projects can also have complex effects on the emotional and affective well-being of participating communities. This article examines how the authors' participatory research with the Maijuna people of the Peruvian Amazon resulted in many positive, affective, and emotional results outside of the final map product. Although the project was initiated as an attempt to produce a map that the Maijuna could use in pursuit of land rights, methodological choices made by the authors also produced positive emotions in participants, political bonding, and community-wide education. While their importance to the political momentum of marginalized communities cannot be overstated, geographers have yet to fully problematize the relationship between these affective and emotional results and their own methodological choices. This article argues that researchers should begin engaging in more affective and emotional thinking when constructing their research methodologies, to both improve the results of their project and to mitigate potential problems.	10.1080/00045608.2012.707596	WOS:000320300300004	2013	The Spatial Politics of Affect and Emotion in Participatory GIS
265	Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been used by traditional cultures for generations as a means to sustain local fisheries for food security. In more recent decades, MPAs have been used by coastal and ocean managers to protect special areas for a wide range of purposes - protecting threatened or rare species, conserving areas for biological diversity and other ecological functions, setting aside areas for recreation - as well as a fisheries management tool. While the role of an MPA in protecting species or biological diversity is fairly well understood, their role as fisheries management tools is more complex and controversial. This paper provides an overview of the use of MPAs as a fisheries management tool in the United States, drawing on the comprehensive MPA Inventory developed and maintained by the National Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA Center).

266	The question of how ecosystem services can be spatially defined and visualized continues to be challenging, particularly for cultural services such as recreation and ecotourism. This study proposes a methodological framework that combines Geographic Information System and participatory methods (Delphi method and Analytic Hierarchy Process) to map recreation and ecotourism at the municipality level. Attributes selected were singular natural resources, scenic beauty, accessibility, tourism attraction capacity, and tourism use aptitude, which were represented by specific spatial criteria validated and weighted by experts. Two types of indicators were obtained and mapped: i) Recreation and ecotourism potential (REPf) which, based on the selected attributes, measured recreation potential in a 0-100 point scale; and ii) Recreation and ecotourism opportunities (REOi), which adjusting REPf by carrying capacity, measured the visitors per hectare that could sustainably recreate in the study area. The resulting maps were highly consistent with the distribution of areas recognized by the tourism authorities as of interest for recreation development (i.e. areas with emblematic flora and fauna and the presence of public and private protected areas). Overall, the methodology demonstrates an important potential for identifying recreation areas to inform local decision making regarding land use planning. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

267	The aim of this study is to examine the spatial distribution of pedestrian injury collisions and analyse the environmental (social and physical) risk factors in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. More specifically, this study investigates the influence of land use, density, traffic and socio-economic characteristics. This cross sectional study is based on pedestrian injury collision data that were collected by the Municipal Transit Police during 20082009. This research presents an analysis of vehiclepedestrian collisions and their spatial risk determinants using mixed methods that included (1) spatial/geographical information systems (GIS) analysis of pedestrian collision data and (2) ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to explain the density of pedestrian collisions data. In our model, we found a higher probability for pedestrian collisions in census tracts with population and employment density, large concentration of commercial/retail land uses and older people (65 and more). Interventions to alleviate this situation including transportation planning such as decentralisation of municipal transport system, investment in road infrastructure density of traffic lights, pedestrian crossing, road design, improves lane demarcation. Besides, land use planning interventions should be implemented in commercial/retail areas, in particular separating pedestrian and vehicular spaces.	10.1080/17457300.2012.724690	WOS:000319376000009	2013	Spatial environmental risk factors for pedestrian injury collisions in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (20082009)
268	Public participation is experiencing increasing recognition as an indispensable component of effective communication and engagement between resource users and managers in natural resource planning and management. To bridge a gap between communication, information and participation, natural resource management agencies have increasingly used the visual capability of spatial decision support tools, such as geographic information systems. Nevertheless, both participation and the use of spatial technologies have been promoted without much consideration of how particular stakeholder groups participate and use existing decision support tools. This paper analyses the current state of public participation and the extent to which spatial data and geographic information tools are used by stakeholder groups to facilitate access to information and to support communication in water quality management on the Great Barrier Reef coast. Data were collected via document analysis, participant observation at stakeholders' meeting, face-to-face interviews and questionnaires. Qualitative data were coded for themes using coding analysis processes, whereas quantitative data from the surveys were analysed using standard exploratory and descriptive statistical techniques. Results reveal that reliance on the natural resource management officer, established networks and personal relationships, and provision of property-scale spatial information are important aspects of a meaningful public participation process.	10.1007/s11852-011-0167-y	WOS:000319165900006	2013	Fits and misfits of linked public participation and spatial information in water quality management on the Great Barrier Reef coast (Australia)
269	The use of ecosystem service maps for conservation planning is increasing. However, their potential for measuring the benefits derived from protected areas has rarely been studied. To overcome this, information gap, we organized two expert workshops based on participatory mapping techniques for Donana and Sierra Nevada protected areas. Protected area managers and scientists mapped service provision hotspots, (SPHs), degraded SPHs and service benefiting areas (SBAs). In Donana, SPHs were located inside the protected area and its surroundings, whereas, degraded SPHs were located primarily within the protected areas. In Sierra Nevada, most SPHs and most degraded SPHs were located inside the protected area. SBAs were located in the surrounding territory for both protected areas, especially in the neighboring cities. We also identified the major issues that faced both protected areas and their drivers of change. We found that most problems originated outside the limits of the protected areas and were produced by drivers associated with economic factors and land use changes. We discuss the implications of using ecosystem services maps for protected area management and the effects of the surrounding territory on areas within the protected zone. The results of our study demonstrate the need for a broader territorial planning strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

270	We are developing a geospatial inventory tool that will guide habitat conservation, restoration and coastal development and benefit several stakeholders who seek mitigation and adaptation strategies to shoreline changes resulting from erosion and sea level rise. The ESRI Geoportal Server, which is a type of web portal used to find and access geospatial information in a central repository, is customized by adding a Geoinventory tool capability that allows any shoreline related data to be searched, displayed and analyzed on a map viewer. Users will be able to select sections of the shoreline and generate statistical reports in the map viewer to allow for comparisons. The tool will also facilitate map-based discussion forums and creation of user groups to encourage citizen participation in decisions regarding shoreline stabilization and restoration, thereby promoting sustainable coastal development.	10.3390/ijgi2020385	WOS:000209465700007	2013	A Collaborative Geospatial Shoreline Inventory Tool to Guide Coastal Development and Habitat Conservation
271	Although it is known by different names, the qualitative quantitative divide is a common enough description for battles between the general and the unique in the social sciences. Whatever value such an academic discussion might have for the pursuit of theory, the goal of applied social science is different. It is, more generally, to solve particular human problems, not to produce universal or law-like understanding. Insofar as applied geography endeavors to link general processes to specific cases, qualitative approaches are uniquely positioned to make meaning in place, impact policy, and transform everyday life. In this article, we discuss three areas in which qualitative methods connect the spectrum of applied geospatial research: Creation, Confirmation, and Connectivity. We show how the union of qualitative methods and a focus on the specific with different geospatial technologies has led to innovative and exciting ways of understanding and visualizing the multifaceted relationships between spatial phenomena. Indeed, through the thoughtful use of qualitative methods, applied geographers can truly begin to understand the complex interactions occurring all around us between society, environment, and place.

272	The New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) is an early adopter of a place-based approach to implementing regional Conservation Management Strategies (CMS). As a new approach, there are few signposts for guidance. The present DOC process relies on a top-down, deductive approach using expert judgement by agency staff. In this study, we examine an alternative approach that uses inductive, public participation GIS (PPGIS) methods to delineate places of significant conservation value. We compare and evaluate the agency's deductive approach with places identified as significant using PPGIS. We discuss the results and present a proposed hierarchy of places framework for use in future place-based conservation management.	10.1080/09640568.2012.685628	WOS:000317825200001	2013	A place-based approach to conservation management using public participation GIS (PPGIS)
273	Urban consolidation projects aiming to support a more sustainable urban form are among the most controversial issues in urban planning. Although planning professionals have reached a rather consistent consensus on the structural characteristics of sustainable urban form, i.e. urban consolidation or densification policy, these goals are often not shared by inhabitants. The resistance by local residents towards densification is based on the fear of losing the environmental qualities that they appreciate without getting added value. We argue that a planning strategy that is sensitive to the local context and respects the inhabitants' place experiences can help in finding unique solutions and in restraining conflicts. To realize the context sensitive strategy, new kind of location-based information from residents is needed: experiential knowledge that is tightly anchored to specific places. In this study, 3119 respondents from the Helsinki metropolitan area participated in a Web-based survey that helped define the quality factors meaningful to inhabitants. The softGIS method used is an example of public participation GIS that allows the study of inhabitants' location-based experiences. The over 10,000 place experiences gathered were analysed in relation to the home locations of respondents and to the number of urban structural characteristics, including urban density, green structure proportion, and land-use patterns. The findings revealed that although green structure was experientially very valuable, densely built areas were also meaningful for inhabitants, especially in regard to social quality. We conclude that the 'soft', experiential information can be a welcome addition to the other layers of information in evidence-based planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

330	The capability to query the topology of spatial regions is fundamental to today's centralized spatial computing systems, like spatial databases and GIS. By contrast, this paper explores decentralized algorithms for computing the topology of spatial regions in wireless sensor networks. The approach generates global topological information about regions, using only the local knowledge of nodes and their immediate network neighbors aggregated up through spatial boundary structures. Using three basic boundary structures (boundary nodes, boundary cycles, and boundary orientation), a family of decentralized algorithms is defined that can respond efficiently to snapshot queries about the topology of spatial regions, including containment and adjacency queries. The communication complexity of the algorithm is O(n) for realistic inputs. Empirical investigation of the performance of the approach, using simulation, also confirms the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of this approach.	10.1109/TC.2010.177	WOS:000292101000005	2011	Efficient, Decentralized Computation of the Topology of Spatial Regions
274	Study of the environmental outcomes of urban densification is a highly context-dependent task. Our study shows that collecting and processing place-based survey data by means of the softGIS method is clearly helpful here. With the map-based internet questionnaire each response remains connected to both the physical environment and the everyday life of the respondent. In our study of the Kuninkaankolmio area (located in the Helsinki metropolitan region) the survey data were combined with urban density variables calculated from register-based data on the existing built environment. The regression analysis indicated that the participants in the survey preferred the same density factors for their future residence as they enjoyed in their current neighbourhood. In the second analysis we related the densities of planned infill developments with the interest respondents had shown in these projects. The results show that new and even quite dense infill developments have been found to be rather attractive, with them often being viewed as interesting supplements to the current urban texture. These findings contribute to the ongoing scientific discussion on the feasibility of densification measures and encourage the Kuninkaankolmio planners to proceed, albeit carefully, with the planned infill developments.	10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/025020	WOS:000321425100067	2013	The prospects for urban densification
275	The appropriate role of the \\public\\" in the planning and management of national forests in the United States is both statutorily vague and socially dynamic. Should forest management be consistent with public values and preferences for these lands? And, how should \\"consistency\\" be defined and evaluated? In 2012, a public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) study was completed for the Chugach National Forest (CNF) in Alaska (United States) that measured public values and preferences to assist future forest plan revision. Place-based public preferences were assessed for consistency with existing CNF national forest plan (2002) prescriptions and to identify areas of potential conflict over forest management direction. Public use preferences were largely consistent with forest plan prescriptions but with some exceptions. Larger-scale analysis of PPGIS preference data provides more detailed information about potential forest conflict and indicates that large-area forest management prescriptions may be too general to guide place-specific forest planning needs. We discuss the use of PPGIS methods for future forest plans, given the release of a new regulatory planning rule for the USDA Forest Service in 2012."

276	The analysis of space and the use of geographic information systems (GIS) have long been important to natural resource applications. More recently, social scientists have been exploring ways to integrate spatial concepts with social science data related to natural resources for theoretical, practical, and methodological reasons. This trend is particularly evident with research in park and protected area (PPA) management and outdoor recreation. The purpose of this paper is to present an updated review of how space has been incorporated into PPA research, integrate concepts and methods, identify gaps, and propose future directions for research. Overall, this review suggests that the incorporation of spatially-related social science data is advancing the field PPA research in an effective and viable way. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

277	Geographers, planners and public health officials are increasingly interested in working with community partners, organizations, and residents to engage in action oriented research designed to impact positive community change. One growing area of community-based research focuses on geographic examinations of aspects of social service accessibility. In this study, we work with multiple community partners in an urban area to examine the spatial distribution of social service providers. We also identify potential new locations for social service providers that can meet the unmet demands for such services. We utilize a Public Participation GIS framework to create shared community resources and research deliverables for our community partners. The results of our work help local providers, leaders, and community residents to visualize gaps and coverage in social services across urban space; draw attention to additional forces that shape access, i.e. public transportation, walkability, and zoning codes; and confirm the anecdotal evidence of poor accessibility presented by neighborhood leaders and residents. The work has practical and actionable implications for lower income urban communities and methodological implications for the disciplines of geography, public health and planning.

279	As a tool of public policy making, PPGIS (public participation geographic information system) makes its biggest impact in regard to empowerment. Quite few methods are available for making a complete evaluation of the empowerment. Using the Meinong Yellow Butterfly Valley as a case study, this article analyzes how the processes and outcomes of the PPGIS make an impact on empowerment in terms of three aspects indicated by the questions: \\What is empowered?\\" \\"Who are empowered?\\" and \\"How to empower?\\" The results show that we are able to completely grasp the impact of PPGIS empowerment by analyzing what, who and how aspects simultaneously. They also indicate that PPGIS empowerment involves mutual transfers of knowledge, capabilities and power among all of the stakeholders, which can't simply be given by outsiders.

281	Qualitative activity space data, i.e. qualitative data associated with the routine locations and activities of individuals, are recognized as increasingly useful by researchers in the social and health sciences for investigating the influence of environment on human behavior. However, there has been little research on techniques for exploring qualitative activity space data. This research illustrates the theoretical principles of combining qualitative and quantitative data and methodologies within the context of geographic information systems (GIS), using visualization as the means of inquiry. Through the use of a prototype implementation of a visualization system for qualitative activity space data and its application in a case study of urban youth we show how these theoretical methodological principles are realized in applied research. The visualization system uses a variety of visual variables to simultaneously depict multiple qualitative and quantitative attributes of individuals' activity spaces. The visualization is applied to explore the activity spaces of a sample of urban youth participating in a study on the geographic and social contexts of adolescent substance use. Examples demonstrate how the visualization can be used to explore individual activity spaces to generate hypotheses, investigate statistical outliers, and explore activity space patterns among subject subgroups.	10.1080/13658816.2012.678362	WOS:000315190800005	2013	Qualitative GIS and the visualization of narrative activity space data
282	Two main types of cognitive maps, route-based and coordinate-based, have been proposed to explain how animals navigate through their environments. We examined patterns of feeding and ranging in Weddell's saddleback tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis weddelli) in northern Bolivia to assess which type of cognitive map best explains the tamarins' movement patterns in large-scale space, e.g., when moving between distant and out-of-sight goals. We observed the tamarins for 236 h over the course of 32 d and used a GPS unit to record the location of nighttime sleeping sites and feeding trees and the locations of individuals at 10-min intervals. Based on an evaluation of 109 travel segments of > 20 m in which the monkeys traveled from the tree of one major feeding species to another without stopping to rest, forage for insects, or interact with neighbors, we calculated a circuity index (actual distance traveled divided by the straight-line distance) of 1.43. We also plotted the monkeys' daily movement patterns using GIS software. These analyses showed that tamarin travel was not random, that a limited set of route segments (N = 29) was reused on multiple occasions, and that certain areas of the forest appeared to serve as switch points (N = 9) where the monkeys reoriented travel. These results support the contention that the tamarins encoded the spatial relationships among many feeding and sleeping sites in their home range, and navigated in large-scale space using a route-based spatial representation. These results are consistent with those reported for a variety of primate taxa, suggesting that many primate species reuse a familiar set of travel routes and switch points to orient in large-scale space.	10.1007/s10764-012-9644-x	WOS:000314048600003	2013	Foraging and Spatial Memory in Wild Weddell's Saddleback Tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis weddelli) When Moving Between Distant and Out-of-Sight Goals
283	This report focuses on the growing interest in the relationship between maps, narratives and meta-narratives. Following a brief historical contextualization of these relationships, this report explores their current state in the Geoweb era. Using the distinction between story maps and grid maps as an analytical framework, I review emerging issues around the extensive use of technologies and online mapping services (i.e. Google maps) to convey stories and to produce new ones. Drawing on literature in film studies, literary studies, visual arts, computer science and communication, I also emphasize the emergence of new forms of spatial expressions interested in providing different perspectives about places and about stories associated to places. In sum, I argue that mapping both vernacular knowledge and fiction is central to understanding places in depth.	10.1177/0309132511423796	WOS:000313734800008	2013	Cartography I
284	On the basis of the principle of sustainable development, land-use planning often requires a compromise between economic development and environmental conservation with social justice advocated. Given that values, perceptions, and ideas vary among stakeholders, land-use planning often involves a variety of conflicts with advocating public participation. In this paper we focus on extending the decision-support capabilities of public participation GIS (PPGIS) to facilitate conflict resolution. In the proposed model, conflicts are designated to be investigated and resolved from two levels, namely the value level and the specifics level. From the value level, a consensus-building process is proposed to help participants promote mutual understanding and achieve group agreement. At the specifics level, participants are asked to search for compromise space through discussions over particular concerns. The ultimate goal of the model is to help participants to work out the most acceptable land-use plan. Moreover, a PPGIS prototype with the conflict-resolution model was designed and implemented in the context of Lantau Island, Hong Kong. The study could contribute to PPGIS research and land-use planning by developing the methodology of conflict resolution. The challenges that we encountered and some future directions are also covered in the paper.	10.1068/b37033	WOS:000319558100010	2013	A model of conflict resolution in public participation GIS for land-use planning
285	This paper describes and explains an interdisciplinary and mixed-method approach to a large-scale sustainable tourism development project. The research took place in a two-county area straddling the Blue Ridge Parkway in the Appalachian mountains of Virginia, USA. It was commissioned in order to develop a sustainable tourism centerpiece to enhance the region and encourage visitor expenditures while maintaining the environment and quality of life of the community. In response to Hollinshead and Jamal's 2007 call for a more bricoleur and third ear approach to tourism research, a gap analysis of the region's tourism offerings was performed using six interdisciplinary, mixed-method research phases seeking to identify discrepancies between the current region's tourism offerings, visitor preferences and community stakeholders. Phases included a Community Resource Assessment (GIS-based Inventory), Stakeholder Interviews, a Visitor Survey and GPS visitor tracking, the development of seven Potential Scenarios, a Potential Visitor Survey and an Economic Analysis. Subsequently, two potential tourism centerpieces were developed with the goal of showcasing the region's unique mountain and agricultural heritage. In addition to providing a detailed overview of the research project, the paper concludes with discussion of the practical and political challenges, time constraints and rewards that accompany this type of research.	10.1080/09669582.2012.709862	WOS:000316116000001	2013	Doing sustainability

287	The emergence and proliferation of neogeographic practices since the mid-2000s have drawn significant attention from GIS scholars. I seek to contribute to the discussion on situating neogeography, particularly through examining the performative dimension of neogeography. To understand performative neogeographic practices I enroll de Certeau's notion of tactics to read these practices as tactical spatial narratives, which may provide different possibilities for spaces of civic engagement and political intervention in an increasingly networked and yet individualized society. I also draw upon theoretical insights from critical GIS and critical social theory to situate and trace the constructions of performative neogeographic practices within particular sociopolitical contexts. Through this synthesized framework, I discuss a case study involved in a participatory art performance project entitled \\Everyone's East Lake\\" in China. Drawing upon interviews and document analysis, the author examines how participants utilize neogeographic mapping as a form of performance and tactical act in response to the dominant corporate and state power. While performative mapping has long been used by artists and cartographers, this case study illustrates how these performative neogeographic practices might highlight different intersections between self-identities, community participation, and sociopolitical conditions, through reconfigurations of mobile and networked mapping technologies. These dynamic, hybrid, and networked mapping practices necessitate a broader conceptualization of activism through mapping in critical GIS research."	10.1068/a45161	WOS:000316035100005	2013	Situating performative neogeography
288	Within the academic and popular discussion of neogeography, it is routinely argued that the process of producing and using geographical information has been fundamentally democratised. Neogeography, in contrast to 'established geography', especially uses the argument that it is for anyone, anywhere, and anytime. Similar arguments have been used to praise the growth in Web GIS since the mid-1990s and seem to be persistent in the conceptualisation of these technologies. However, what is the nature of this democracy, and to what extent do the technologies that are used in neogeography fulfil this democratisation promise? In this contribution the framework offered by Andrew Feenberg in his critical theory of technology, and especially his call for 'deep democratisation', is used to provide a critique of these assertions of the nature of neogeography. The analysis shows that, unlike early critical GIS and the literature on participatory GIS, the analysis of neogeography adopted an instrumentalist interpretation of the technology and its applications. This view claims that technology is value free and that there is a separation between means and ends. This type of argument ignores and disguises the values that are integrated inexorably in advanced technologies. Once the values are exposed and discussed, neogeography becomes far less exciting and transformative. It becomes clear that there is a separation between a technological elite and a wider group of uninformed, labouring participants who are not empowered through the use of the technology. There are also multiple obstacles that limit the democratic potential of neogeography. The analysis progresses by considering the hierarchy of hacking, understood here as the ability to alter and change the meaning and use of a specific technological system. This hierarchy further explains the democratisation potentialities and limits of neogeography. Because of the reduced barriers, neogeography does offer some increased level of democratisation but, to fulfil this potential, it requires careful implementation that takes into account social and political aspects.	10.1068/a45184	WOS:000316035100006	2013	Neogeography and the delusion of democratisation
289	This paper presents a method for identifying and monitoring regional tourism development preferences using an Internet public participation geographic information system (PPGIS). In 2004, a large baseline study of landscape values and development preferences was completed on Kangaroo Island (KI), South Australia, using low technology, paper-map PPGIS. In 2010, we implemented an Internet-based PPGIS monitoring study with the same participants to (1) determine the efficacy of smaller scale monitoring efforts using an Internet-based PPGIS, (2) examine whether residents' tourism development preferences had changed over the last six years and (3) assess the strengths and weaknesses of the PPGIS methodology for identifying changes in tourism development preferences. Since KI is the first international tourism destination to adopt the Tourism Optimization Management Model (TOMM) for monitoring tourism outcomes, we contrast the PPGIS monitoring method with information from the TOMM process. Our results indicate that tourism development preferences remained relatively stable over the past six years with some small changes on the western reach of the island. We argue that an Internet-based PPGIS method can be an effective tool for tourism development planning and monitoring because the method is place-based, cost-effective and provides tighter coupling with land use planning controls such as zoning.	10.1080/09669582.2012.693501	WOS:000314891300002	2013	Using public participation GIS (PPGIS) on the Geoweb to monitor tourism development preferences
290	New map-based online tools have the potential to facilitate citizen participation in discussing the impacts of tourism. This research investigates the use of GeospatialWeb 2.0 (Geoweb) tools to gather volunteered geographic information (VGI) on tourism-related environmental change from citizens of Barbados. We hosted participatory mapping workshops where groups of Barbadians directly contributed content to a series of online maps. These maps were made with the free Google My Map tool, allowing users to interact with detailed satellite imagery of Barbados. Qualitative observations were added and geo-referenced to these maps identifying several types of environmental change concerns, both those generated by tourism, and those with implications for tourism development. We analysed how participants used Google My Maps, identifying concerns of accuracy, data completeness and digital/computer literacy amongst users that could affect further use of this tool. Overall, the Geoweb approach provided participants with a unique perspective on environmental change that facilitated deeper discussion of issues and produced a publicly available, spatially referenced record of citizen concerns. Further research needs are demonstrated, including user interface design, accuracy and uncertainty, and how to manage varying levels of digital literacy.	10.1080/09669582.2012.699059	WOS:000314891300003	2013	Tourism and environmental change in Barbados
291	Human values are embedded in forest management decisions but are rarely systematically and explicitly included in the decision process. National legislation for public lands often provides conflicting goals but little guidance for agencies such as the U. S. Forest Service to operationalize public value preferences. The historical difficulty of integrating public values into forest management decisions includes the problems of measurement, aggregation, and tradeoff analysis. In this paper, we present a method for measuring and integrating spatially-explicit public values collected using public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) into a decision support framework we call values compatibility analysis (VCA). We provide a case study to demonstrate how spatially-explicit public values can be used to determine the compatibility of designating ATV/OHV routes on national forest land. The applications and limitations of VCA for decision support are elaborated and we conclude that an effective decision support framework should provide some degree of standardization, be broadly inclusive, and provide the opportunity to engage in systematic place-based value trade-off analyses.	10.1007/s12061-011-9072-x	WOS:000318972900003	2012	Values Compatibility Analysis
294	The human perception and valuation of landscapes is a complex process but has been pragmatically advanced through public participation GIS (PPGIS). PPGIS methods have the capacity to generate spatial data to empirically examine relationships between human landscape values and physical landscape character. In 2011, PPGIS methods were used to identify a range of social landscape values for two regions in southern New Zealand, Otago and Southland. Seven of these landscape values were analysed to identify significant relationships with physical landscape character from the New Zealand Landscape Classification system. In this paper we examine methods to extrapolate landscape values from this regional data set to a national level using these landscape value and character relationships. In the absence of empirical value data at a national level, we examine two quantitative approaches for extrapolating landscape values: (1) landscape component weights based on the percentage of value counts found within landscape components, and (2) landscape component weights based on the ratio of landscape values to the landscape area. We prepare and present maps of seven landscape values for the entire country of New Zealand to demonstrate the method. We conclude that landscape value extrapolation can assist impact assessment for land use change but should be kept simple for decision support. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

295	The production and consumption of geographic information is becoming a more mobile practice, with more corporate actors challenging the traditional stronghold of Esri- and government-based geospatial developments. What can be considered a geographic information system has expanded to include web-based technologies like Google Earth/Maps, as well as more recent developments of Microsoft's Bing Maps and the mobile version of ArcGIS available for the iPhone. In addition to these developments, a discursive shift toward 'location' is occurring across the Internet industry. Location has become the new buzzword for social-spatial strategies to target consumers. As reported in 2010, venture capitalists have, since 2009, invested $115 million into location start-ups' - software companies that provide location-based services to mobile computing consumers (Miller and Wortham, 2010). Applications like Foursquare, Loopt, Gowalla, and most recently, Facebook Places allow users to 'check-in' at restaurants, bars, gyms, retail outlets, and offices, thereby sharing their location within their social network. These developments enable consumers to (re)discover their proximities to products, while feeding a desire for making known one's everyday movements. Here. I discuss the development of location-based services as the proliferation of a peculiar form of geographic information: conspicuous mobility. Through discussion of a recent gathering of location-aware software professionals and through analysis of discourses that emerge over a battle between 'check in' companies. I sketch an area of study that explores the implications of these emerging geographic information 'systems', and new everyday cartographers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

296	Understanding the spatial. dimension of fear of crime in the urban environment is important to understanding behaviors in response to this concern. Making this connection between perception and action has long been a goal of scholars in the social and health sciences, though this complex relationship has yet to be fully elucidated. Specifically, in studies on fear of crime and its influence on behavior, a variety of definitions and methods have been employed. This situation has yielded insights, as well as inconsistencies. In the past decade, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has been added to this methodological mix, though it too has contributed limited understanding of the environmental perception-behavior nexus. During this time, sonic scholars have integrated a traditional technique for accessing environmental perception, the sketch map, with this newer technology. This article provides a review and critical assessment: of the way GIS has been used to understand fear of crime, specifically through the integration of sketch maps. This focus is framed by an overview of substantive and methodological concerns and concludes with a discussion of continued research needs. As behavioral responses to fear of crime are acknowledged to impact physical and mental health and overall well-being, in addition to the viability of neighborhoods, research in this area will continue apace. However, for integration of sketch maps in GIS to be a valuable methodological contributor to this line of inquiry, users of the approach must understand its complexities. This article outlines these issues so that they may be considered in future research and may improve the ability for this approach to yield new understanding of fear of crime.	10.1559/15230406394175	WOS:000310560900001	2012	Integrating Sketch Maps with GIS to Explore Fear of Crime in the Urban Environment
297	Site-specific agriculture has been adopted in a high-tech context using, for instance, in situ sensors, satellite images for remote sensing analysis, and some other technological devices. However, farmers and smallholders without the economic resources and required knowledge to use and to access the latest technology seem to find an impediment to precision agricultural practices. This article discusses the possibility of adopting precision agriculture (PA) principles for site-specific management but in a low technology context for such farmers. The proposed methodology to support PA combines low technology dependency and a participatory approach by involving smallholders, farmers and experts. The case studies demonstrate how the interplay of low technology and a participative approach may be suitable for smallholders for site-specific agriculture analysis.	10.1007/s11119-012-9267-4	WOS:000308345400006	2012	Participative site-specific agriculture analysis for smallholders
303	Updating cadastral information is crucial for recording land ownership and property division changes in a timely fashioned manner. In most cases, the existing cadastral maps do not provide up-to-date information on land parcel boundaries. Such a situation demands that all the cadastral data and parcel boundaries information in these maps to be updated in a timely fashion. The existing techniques for acquiring cadastral information are discipline-oriented based on different disciplines such as geodesy, surveying, and photogrammetry. All these techniques require a large number of manpower, time, and cost when they are carried out separately. There is a need to integrate these techniques for acquiring cadastral information to update the existing cadastral data and (re)produce cadastral maps in an efficient manner. To reduce the time and cost involved in cadastral data acquisition, this study develops an integrated approach by integrating global position system (GPS) data, remote sensing (RS) imagery, and existing cadastral maps. For this purpose, the panchromatic image with 0.6 m spatial resolution and the corresponding multi-spectral image with 2.4m spatial resolution and 3 spectral bands from QuickBird satellite were used. A digital elevation model (DEM) was extracted from SPOT-5 stereopairs and some ground control points (GCPs) were also used for ortho-rectifying the QuickBird images. After ortho-rectifying these images and registering the multi-spectral image to the panchromatic image, fusion between them was attained to get good quality multi-spectral images of these two study areas with 0.6 m spatial resolution. Cadastral parcel boundaries were then identified on QuickBird images of the two study areas via visual interpretation using participatory-GIS (PGIS) technique. The regions of study are the urban and rural areas of Peshawar and Swabi districts in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The results are the creation of updated cadastral maps with a lot of cadastral information which can be used in updating the existing cadastral data with less time and cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

298	Among the main effects of human activities on the environment are land use and resulting land cover changes. Such changes impact the capacity of ecosystems to provide goods and services to the human society. This supply of multiple goods and services by nature should match the demands of the society, if self-sustaining human-environmental systems and a sustainable utilization of natural capital are to be achieved. To describe respective states and dynamics, appropriate indicators and data for their quantification, including quantitative and qualitative assessments, are needed. By linking land cover information from, e.g. remote sensing, land survey and GIS with data from monitoring, statistics, modeling or interviews, ecosystem service supply and demand can be assessed and transferred to different spatial and temporal scales. The results reveal patterns of human activities over time and space as well as the capacities of different ecosystems to provide ecosystem services under changing land use. Also the locations of respective demands for these services can be determined. As maps are powerful tools, they hold high potentials for visualization of complex phenomena. We present an easy-to-apply concept based on a matrix linking spatially explicit biophysical landscape units to ecological integrity, ecosystem service supply and demand. An exemplary application for energy supply and demand in a central German case study region and respective maps for the years 1990 and 2007 are presented. Based on these data, the concept for an appropriate quantification and related spatial visualization of ecosystem service supply and demand is elaborated and discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

299	Human attribution of multiple values to landscapes is not well understood owing to the variability and complexity of both the landscape concept and the human valuation process. In this study, we extend psychophysical analysis of landscapes by examining the relationships between multiple landscape values and physical landscape character. Previous landscape research has tended to focus on the relationship between a single value such as landscape aesthetics and a single physical landscape component, such as vegetation or water. We spatially intersected eight landscape values collected through a regional public participation GIS (PPGIS) process with landscape components and classes from the New Zealand Land Classification (NZLC) system. We used chi-square residual analysis and correspondence analysis to identify significant spatial associations. The results indicate that the general public associate particular values with specific landscape components at a regional scale. Greater than expected landscape values were associated with urban areas, water features, indigenous landcover, and mountains. Fewer than expected landscape values were associated with flatter, agricultural landscapes. We discuss the benefits and limitations of these methods for landscape assessment in New Zealand. and in the absence of PPGIS data to directly measure landscape values, whether landscape components should be used to interpolate values for landscape assessment. We urge replication of the method in other regions to increase the external validity of the landscape value-physical landscape associations described herein. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

300	State interventions to govern social vulnerability highlight the complexity of contemporary states, marked by neoliberal agenda but also by progressive interventions and the desire for effectiveness. This paper draws on collaborative research with government agencies on social vulnerability in the Hunter region to assess the desirability of undertaking critical geographies with the state. We see states as contested terrains invested with the institutional capacity to mobilise diverse political projects. We argue that critical research in partnership with states is possible, as are mobilisations of the agency of state institutions to promote progressive policy development. The paper explores how we might use engaged research to intersect with the production and circulation of texts, technologies and practices within the state apparatus to achieve desirable change. While critical research with the state involves uncertainties and compromise, with no permanent resolutions, we conclude that states must remain centred in our critical conversations and praxis. In this paper we advance the case for the critical possibilities of policy-oriented research with the state. We reflect on experiences of an engaged research project with state government agencies in the NSW Hunter Region involving the production and use of the texts and technologies as state interventions in social vulnerability. Working through the project's reflexive, collaborative methodologies and our use of critical GIS, we highlight the creation of opportunities to change how the components of social vulnerability were conceptualised, contest policymakers view of what was relevant, and shift framing rationalities and resultant state practices. As such the paper contributes to our knowledge of strategic research practices for pursuing critical, progressive projects with the state. Such engagement involves uncertainties and contingent compromise. Yet, as terrains of contestation wherein diverse political projects are assembled and propelled, states must remain centred in our critical conversations and in our critical praxis.	10.1111/j.1467-8330.2011.00976.x	WOS:000307379600018	2012	Critical Geographies with the State
301	Nonprofit organizations often pursue land acquisition as a nonpolitical, private property rights approach to conservation of ecological and cultural resources. Yet acquisition and regulatory land-use planning are intertwined, both in terms of political strategies and conservation outcomes. Our objectives are (1) to understand the relationship between the acquisition strategies of land trusts and their involvement in land-use planning and zoning, and (2) to examine how the interactions between acquisition and land-use planning may shape conservation outcomes. We focus on the strategies of The Nature Conservancy, one of the largest conservation NGOs in the United States. Drawing from an institutional analysis framework, we compare case studies from Tehama and Monterey Counties, California. Through semistructured interviews, analysis of land-use plans and conservation-easement agreements, and GIS mapping we examine political strategies and conservation outcomes. Our analysis reveals that acquisition strategies and the regulatory context influence each other strongly, but that tensions between the politics of these strategies challenge conservation actors to deploy both effectively. Finally, we develop themes for future research, suggesting that the implementation and assessment of regional conservation efforts would benefit from an integrated strategy that recognizes the synergistic linkages between acquisition and regulatory land-use planning.	10.1068/a44395	WOS:000309307900006	2012	Land-conservation strategies
302	This action-research project aimed to test a participatory mapping methodology using Google Earth to develop shared understandings among participants about sustainability and climate change. The process focused on improving knowledge uptake and enabling dialogue among participants in order to develop adaptation strategies for Rottnest Island, off the Western Australian coast. Project results indicate increased levels of knowledge and commitment to active involvement in sustainability and climate change issues. Common threads came together in a coherent set of recommendations that will contribute to ongoing climate change and sustainability planning by the Rottnest Island Authority. Major conclusions drawn include: the usefulness of Google Earth for participatory planning for climate adaptation and sustainability; the methodology enables social, economic, ecological and cultural layers to be considered without any having primacy; care must be taken to ensure knowledge and power differential are managed effectively; and, the methodology brought together stakeholders and scientists to co-produce knowledge and decisions.

304	The evaluation of landscape services essentially deals with the complex and dynamic relationships between humans and their environment. When it comes to landscape management and the evaluation of the benefits these services provide for our well-being, there is a limited representation of stakeholder and intangible values on the land. Stakeholder knowledge is essential, since disciplinary expert evaluations and existing proxy data on landscape services can reveal little of the landscape benefits to the local stakeholders. This paper aims at evaluating the potential of using local stakeholders as key informants in the spatial assessment of landscape service indicators. A methodological approach is applied in the context of a rural village environment in Tanzania, Zanzibar, where local, spatially sensitive stakeholder knowledge is crucial in solving land management challenges as the resources are used extensively for supporting community livelihoods and are threatened by economic uses and agricultural expansion. A typology of 19 different material and non-material, cultural landscape service indicators is established and, in semi-structured interviews, community stakeholders map these indicators individually on an aerial image. The landscape service indicators are described and spatially analysed in order to establish an understanding of landscape level service structures, patterns and relationships. The results show that community involvement and participatory mapping enhance the assessment of landscape services. These benefits from nature demonstrate spatial clustering and co-existence, but simultaneously also a tendency for spatial dispersion, and suggest that there is far more heterogeneity and sensitivity in the ways the benefits are distributed in relation to actual land resources. Many material landscape service indicators are individually based and spatially scattered in the landscape. However, the well-being of communities is also dependent on the non-material services, pointing out shared places of social interaction and cultural traditions. Both material and non-material services are preferred closest to settlements where the highest intensity, richness and diversity are found. Based on the results, the paper discusses the role of local stakeholders as experts in landscape service assessments and implications for local level management processes. It can be pointed out that the integration of participatory mapping methods in landscape service assessments is crucial for true collaborative, bottom-up landscape management. It is also necessary in order to capture the non-utilitarian value of landscapes and sensitivity to cultural landscape services, which many expert evaluations of landscape or ecosystem services fail to do justice.

305	Geographical information systems (GIS) have been a part of archaeological research practices for over two decades, yet many significant questions related to the technology remain unanswered. Long-standing ambiguities about GIS use in archaeology can be associated with a particular research atmosphere within the discipline, where a large number of practitioners consider theory-laden critical approaches to GIS optional, if not peripheral, to conducting spatial analysis. This article calls on archaeological GIS practitioners to carry existing GIS theory and critique to another level. It also argues that the critique of the epistemological implications of GIS use in archaeology has largely (and at times rather implicitly) been structured by representational thinking habits and that a move to non-representational thinking would provide novel considerations of the technology.	10.1177/1469605312439139	WOS:000304700200005	2012	GIS, critique, representation and beyond
306	Public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) refers to methods that seek to integrate public knowledge of places to inform land use planning and decision making. There is little published information on the spatial accuracy of PPGIS data compared to expert-derived GIS data. This study assesses the spatial accuracy of PPGIS data collected for conservation planning in two regions of New Zealand in 2011 by comparing participant mapped locations of native vegetation with areas identified in the New Zealand Land Cover Database (LCDB) Version 2. Spatial error was operationalized as PPGIS locations having no native vegetation within 1000 m. The results indicate relatively low PPGIS spatial error of about 6% compared to 22% for randomly selected point locations in the regions. Spatial error is largest in coastal regions and near population centers where native vegetation is sparse and patchy. Participant familiarity with the study region is related to spatial error and is reflected in PPGIS sampling groups, with randomly sampled households having the largest error rate and the self-selected public, the lowest error rate. The results indicate a competitive, trade-off relationship between PPGIS participation rates and spatial accuracy. Future PPGIS research should identify processes with the capacity to increase both participation and spatial accuracy concurrently. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

307	Place values, like human values, are hypothesized to be relatively stable and slow to change over time. In 2004, we conducted a baseline study of place values, called landscape values, with residents of Kangaroo Island (KI), South Australia, using public participation GIS (PPGIS). In 2010, we implemented an internet-based PPGIS monitoring study with the same households to measure changes in the importance and spatial distribution of landscape values. The empirical results indicate general stability in values both in importance and spatial distribution. But the results also suggest that land-use changes such as those resulting from human development will significantly influence the distribution of landscape values. Additional research is needed to advance understanding of landscape values for identifying land-use compatibilities and conflict, and managing public lands in a manner consistent with public values.

308	Participatory mapping of indigenous lands and resources is increasingly seen as a precondition for securing legal recognition of indigenous land rights. But because participatory mapping might have unintended impacts on the functioning of rural communities, researchers have put a great effort in analyzing the effects of participatory mapping. In this article, we used a randomized evaluation to assess the effects of participatory mapping in conflicts with external actors and with neighbouring villages in the Tsimane' indigenous territory, Bolivian Amazon. We randomly assigned villages to a treatment and a control group, conducted participatory mapping with villages in the treatment group, and evaluated the effects of mapping village resources on the number of reported conflicts with and attitudes towards a) external actors and b) indigenous peoples from other villages. The exercise allows us to assess the effect of participatory mapping on conflicts while controlling for the political context. Results from our study indicate that conducting participatory mapping in randomly selected villages did not produce any effect of real or statistical significance on either 1) the number of conflicts with outsiders entering Tsimane' villages, 2) the number of conflicts with Tsimane' from other villages, 3) negative attitudes or opinions of outsiders, or 4) negative attitudes or opinion of Tsimane' from other villages. Our results suggest that some of the effects that have been attributed to participatory mapping are not the inevitable outcome of mapping per se; rather, they probably stem from other previous or ongoing processes that determine whether communities engage in mapping their lands and how they do so.

310	Besides topological relationships and approximate relationships, cardinal directions like north and southwest have turned out to be an important class of qualitative spatial relationships. They are of interdisciplinary interest in fields like cognitive science, robotics, artificial intelligence, and qualitative spatial reasoning. In spatial databases and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) they are frequently used as join and selection criteria in spatial queries. However, the available computational models of cardinal directions suffer a number of problems like the use of too coarse approximations of the two spatial operand objects in terms of single representative points or minimum bounding rectangles, the lacking property of converseness of the cardinal directions computed, and the limited applicability to simple instead of complex regions only. This article proposes and formally defines a novel two-phase model, called the Objects Interaction Matrix (OIM) model, that solves these problems, and determines cardinal directions for even complex regions. The model consists of a tiling phase and an interpretation phase. In the tiling phase, a tiling strategy first determines the zones belonging to the nine cardinal directions of each individual region object and then intersects them. The result leads to a bounded grid called objects interaction grid. For each grid cell the information about the region objects that intersect it is stored in an objects interaction matrix. In the subsequent interpretation phase, a well-defined interpretation method is applied to such a matrix and determines the cardinal direction. Spatial example queries illustrate our new cardinal direction concept that is embedded in a spatial extension of SQL and provides user-defined cardinal direction predicates.	10.1145/2188349.2188350	WOS:000304769100001	2012	Cardinal Directions between Complex Regions
311	This article examines how 2000 US census statistics serve to reproduce Arab Americans as a social body with specific political possibilities. Its first goal is to show how the conventionally used census data acts as a source of statistical and, furthermore, social and political marginalization by rendering Arab Americans, who poorly fit into its racial classification, either invisible or lacking in internal heterogeneity. The result is absent viable political identity for Arab Americans, general ignorance of their experiences in the United States, and negative stereotyping. Because in the post-9/11 United States, Arab American advocacy groups have turned to statistics, among other means, to forge positive visibility, our second goal is to suggest innovative and practical ways to make a more informed use of the existing census statistics despite that their categorical and numerical inconsistencies relative to Arab American identities. Instead of a quantitative analysis, we thus offer a feminist inspired method of \\mapping for difference\\" three census datasets-Arabic language spoken at home, place of birth in an Arab nation, and Arab ancestry, which involves applying a primarily qualitative analysis to these variables while contextualizing them by immigration history. Our result is a set of heterogeneous Arab American geographies, not intended for better quantitative description but serving to counter practices of marginalization by broadening public imagination and knowledge about this diverse community. Throughout, we suggest that while the designation Arab American maybe practically and politically useful, the recognition of the heterogeneity of Arab community along multiple dimensions of difference must be built into the methods of analysis. We demonstrate our major points with selected empirical maps from our larger research project on the census-based geographies of Arab Americans in the New York metropolitan area, one of the largest and most understudied communities in North America.

312	Volunteered geographic information and social networking in a WebGIS has the potential to increase public participation in soil and water conservation, promote environmental awareness and change, and provide timely data that may be otherwise unavailable to policymakers in soil and water conservation management. The objectives of this study were: (1) to develop a framework for combining current technologies, computing advances, data sources, and social media; and (2) develop and test an online web mapping interface. The mapping interface integrates Microsoft Silverlight, Bing Maps, ArcGIS Server, Google Picasa Web Albums Data API, RSS, Google Analytics, and Facebook to create a rich user experience. The website allows the public to upload photos and attributes of their own subdivisions or sites they have identified and explore other submissions. The website was made available to the public in early February 2011 at http://www.AbandonedDevelopments.com and evaluated for its potential longterm success in a pilot study.	10.1007/s00267-012-9818-5	WOS:000302339300005	2012	An Integrated WebGIS Framework for Volunteered Geographic Information and Social Media in Soil and Water Conservation
313	This paper identifies a failure by mobilities scholars to engage with the methodological and analytical possibilities offered by qualitative GIS. We argue this represents a missed opportunity and present the spatial transcript, a technique we have developed in order to address this shortcoming. Qualitative GIS seeks to find ways to analyse how space shapes data, offering a useful way in to investigating the mobile body. The spatial transcript allows researchers to engage in a process of grounded visualisation in order to analyse interview data in the context of the location in which it was gathered. We conclude that this technique offers valuable insights into the ways that space and mobilities are co-constructed.	10.1111/j.1475-4762.2011.01058.x	WOS:000299374500013	2012	The spatial transcript
314	Geographers play important roles in public health research, particularly in understanding healthcare accessibility, utilisation, and individual healthcare experiences. Most accessibility studies have benefited from the increased sophistication of geographic information systems (GIS). Some studies have been enhanced with semi-structured in-depth interviews to understand individual experiences of people as they access healthcare. However, few accessibility studies have explicitly utilised individual in-depth interview data in the construction of new GIS accessibility measures. Using mixed methods including GIS analysis and individual data from semi-structured in-depth interviews, we offer satisfaction-adjusted distance as a new way of conceptualising accessibility in GIS. Based on fieldwork in a predominantly lower-income community in Columbus, Ohio (USA), we find many residents felt neighbourhood healthcare facilities offered low-quality care, which suggested an added perceived distance as they attempt to access high-quality healthcare facilities. The satisfaction-adjusted distance measure accounts for the perceived distance some residents feel as they search for high-quality healthcare in lower-income urban neighbourhoods. In moving beyond conventional GIS and re-conceptualising accessibility in this way, we offer a more realistic portrayal of the issues lower-income urban residents face as they attempt to access high-quality healthcare facilities. The work has theoretical implications for conceptualising healthcare accessibility, advances the mixed-methodologies literature, and argues for a more equitable distribution of high-quality healthcare in urban neighbourhoods.	10.1111/j.1475-4959.2011.00411.x	WOS:000299380500005	2012	Using GIS and perceived distance to understand the unequal geographies of healthcare in lower-income urban neighbourhoods
319	The interface between neogeography and citizen science has great potential for environmental monitoring, but this nexus has been explored less often than each subject individually. In this article we review the emerging role of volunteered geographic information in citizen science and present a case study of an integrated tool set that engages multiple types of users (from targeted citizen-based observation networks, expert-driven focused monitoring, and opportunistic crowdsourcing efforts) in monitoring a forest disease in the western United States. We first introduce the overall challenge of data collection in environmental monitoring projects and then discuss the literature surrounding an emergent integration of citizen science and volunteered geographical information. We next explore how these methods characterize and underpin knowledge discovery and how multimodal interaction is supported so that a large spectrum of contributors can be included. These concepts are summarized in a conceptual model that articulates the important gradients of Web-based environmental monitoring: the users, the interaction between users and data, and the types of information generated. Using this model, we critically examine OakMapper.org, a Web site created by the authors to collect and distribute spatial information related to the spread of a forest disease, and discuss many of the core issues and new challenges presented by the intersection of citizen science and volunteered geographic information in the context of environmental monitoring. We argue that environmental monitoring can benefit from this synergy: The increased emphasis on a diversity of participants in knowledge production might help to reduce the gaps that have in the past divided the public, researchers, and policymakers in such efforts.	10.1080/00045608.2011.627058	WOS:000309602900003	2012	Citizen Science in the Age of Neogeography
320	The dry rangelands of West Asia and North Africa are fragile and severely degraded due to low rainfall and mismanagement of natural resources. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) interventions are used to increase soil moisture content, vegetation cover, and productivity. However, adoption of rainwater harvesting by communities is slow. To understand adoption constraints and to develop options for sustainable integration of rainwater harvesting, a benchmark watershed was established in the dry rangelands of Jordan. The objective is to develop a methodology for identifying the suitability for different rainwater harvesting interventions using participatory GIS approach and field survey. The main biophysical parameters used to assess the suitability for rainwater harvesting were slope, soil depth, soil texture, and stoniness. Criteria for each parameter were integrated and a suitability map was produced using raster-based and polygon-based analysis. To integrate biophysical and socio-economic aspects, the land tenure was superimposed with the suitability map. Options for implementing different rainwater harvesting interventions were identified with the participation of the local communities. Field investigations indicated that the applied approach helped to select the most promising fields. Within two years, four types of rainwater harvesting were implemented in the fields of 41 farmers, covering 62.9 hectares, which helped to increase water productivity (kg/m(3)) four folds and reducing soil erosion five folds compared to fields without rainwater harvesting. The approach showed that participatory GIS approach may be used to integrate socio-economic and biophysical criteria and facilitate the participation of farmers to introduce rainwater harvesting interventions in dry rangeland systems to mitigate land degradation.	10.1080/15324982.2012.709214	WOS:000308994400003	2012	A Participatory GIS Approach for Assessing Land Suitability for Rainwater Harvesting in an Arid Rangeland Environment

Specific research objectives were to examine the distribution of ecosystem services, identify the characteristics of participants in the study, explore potential relationships between ecosystem services and land use and land cover (LULC) classifications, and assess the methodological strengths and weakness of the PPGIS approach for identifying ecosystem services. Key findings include: (1) Cultural ecosystem service opportunities were easiest to identify while supporting and regulatory services most challenging, (2) participants were highly educated, knowledgeable about nature and science, and have a strong connection to the outdoors, (3) some LULC classifications were logically and spatially associated with ecosystem services, and (4) despite limitations, the PPGIS method demonstrates potential for identifying ecosystem services to augment expert judgment and to inform public or environmental policy decisions regarding land use trade-offs.	10.1080/08941920.2011.621511	WOS:000304475300002	2012	Public Participation GIS
322	The convergence of newly interactive Web-based technologies with growing practices of user-generated content disseminated on the Internet is generating a remarkable new form of geographic information. Citizens are using handheld devices to collect geographic information and contribute it to crowd-sourced data sets, using Web-based mapping interfaces to mark and annotate geographic features, or adding geographic location to photographs, text, and other media shared online. These phenomena, which generate what we refer to collectively as volunteered geographic information (VGI), represent a paradigmatic shift in how geographic information is created and shared and by whom, as well as its content and characteristics. This article, which draws on our recently completed inventory of VGI initiatives, is intended to frame the crucial dimensions of VGI for geography and geographers, with an eye toward identifying its potential in our field, as well as the most pressing research needed to realize this potential. Drawing on our ongoing research, we examine the content and characteristics of VGI, the technical and social processes through which it is produced, appropriate methods for synthesizing and using these data in research, and emerging social and political concerns related to this new form of information.	10.1080/00045608.2011.595657	WOS:000303109900004	2012	Researching Volunteered Geographic Information
323	Recent scholarship has urged increased attention to how advances in geographical information systems (GIS) technology can more equitably help to bridge gaps between the theory and practice of environmental protection and dispute resolution. This study brings new evidence to burgeoning debates in the Amazon, examining how a United Nations (UN) development initiative developed mapping systems in a shifting political climate for environmental governance while conducting campaigns with peasant miners to address environmental management. Amendments made in 2002 to the Brazilian Forest Code established natural preserves according to the geographic features of watersheds. The laws deter commercial land use on preserves, imposing strict penalties where artisanal mining is widely prevalent as a livelihood. The UN program utilized GIS and Shuttle Radar imagery to map the contested areas according to legal definitions and engaged stakeholders to discuss political implications. In 2006, new reforms made such mapping tools even more controversial-and urgent-with amendments that created opportunities for bringing \\informal\\" mining into the legal sphere, theoretically allowing \\"spaces of exception\\" where mining can be legitimated. Our multimethod study underscores the need for appreciating diverse understandings of ecologically sensitive zones and empowering rural communities to take ownership over geospatial technologies in addressing environmental challenges. Although maps produced using the proposed methods could be useful, dominant advocacies that champion GIS as an enforcement tool often undermine local trust, inflame tensions, and render alternative \\"grassrootsGIS\\" strategies impracticable. We examine the contexts, powers, limitations, and risks of the UN's technical intervention, exploring how competing views of environmental controversy lead to divergent perspectives on the politics of GIS \\"knowledge translation\\" and mapping itself."	10.1080/00045608.2011.641861	WOS:000301652200004	2012	Mapping Spaces of Environmental Dispute
324	Collaborative and community-based approaches to conservation and natural resource management often utilize maps that designate particular areas as being high priorities for conservation. These maps are used in stakeholder workshops and/or public discourse, but have often been highly contentious and counterproductive. We propose that quantifying and visualizing some of the uncertainty involved in making such maps could decrease their potential for causing conflict, thereby facilitating discourse and eventually, conservation action. We propose that an extra bonus could be attained by mapping the effects of missing or sparse input data regarding landowner \\willingness to conserve\\" (given fair market compensation). The primary contributions of this action research are in the development of the propositions and in their implementation using a stochastic approach (Monte Carlo simulation). Preliminary assessment of the propositions occurred, but further research is needed to more formally evaluate them. Some practical suggestions and additional research considerations are provided."	10.1080/08941920.2011.578119	WOS:000301515500003	2012	Mapping Uncertainty in Conservation Assessment as a Means Toward Improved Conservation Planning and Implementation
325	The collection of spatial information through public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) is most frequently implemented using either point or polygon spatial features but the research trade-offs between the two methods are not well-understood. In a quasi-experimental PPGIS design, we collected four attributes (aesthetic, recreation, economic, and biological values) as both point and polygon spatial features in the same PPGIS study. We then used Monte Carlo simulation methods to describe the relationship between the quantity of data collected and the degree of spatial convergence in the two methods for each of the four PPGIS attributes. The results demonstrate that the same PPGIS attributes identified by points and polygons will converge on a collective spatial 'truth' within the study area provided there are enough observations, however, the degree of spatial convergence varies by PPGIS attribute type and the quantity of data collected. The use of points for mapping PPGIS attributes and aggregating areas through density mapping constitutes a conservative approach to spatial inference about place significance, but the data demands for point collection are considerably higher than for polygon features. Based on our results, we provide heuristic guidelines for future PPGIS research when using point or polygon spatial attributes. We argue that other variables such as the cognitive complexity of the PPGIS mapping process and stronger claims of external validity favor the use of point features, but these advantages must be weighed against the significantly higher sampling effort required.	10.1080/13658816.2011.585139	WOS:000300611200003	2012	An evaluation of the use of points versus polygons in public participation geographic information systems using quasi-experimental design and Monte Carlo simulation
326	The last few decades have seen increasing attempts to foster 'collaborative' and 'participatory' approaches to spatial planning and decision-making, with a more sophisticated conceptualisation of the contested term, participation. Participatory, 'bottom-up' geo-information technologies have been concurrently developing and these are expected to strengthen participatory spatial planning: important among these has been the transformation of conventional mapping and GIS tools into Participatory GIS (PGIS). In this paper we explore the potential contributions of participatory geo-information tools towards participatory spatial planning, in terms of the principles and criteria of good governance. We discuss five fundamental principles of 'good' governance: accountability, legitimacy, respect, equity, and competence, and the potential of geo-information tools to contribute to, and detract from, such principles: although we focus especially on participation and the recognition and validation of local knowledge. We derive criteria for the five principles, and we identify a range of evaluation questions which can be operationalised so as to interrogate the criteria for judging the contribution of participatory tools and participatory spatial planning activities. We conclude by summarily assessing the potentials of participatory geo-information tools, particularly participatory mobile GIS, participatory 3-dimensional modelling, and visualisation features in PGIS.

327	In order to design computer systems that are intuitive to use, the way humans reason about their \\real world\\" surroundings needs to be taken into consideration. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) focus on spatial reasoning. Over the last decades, many advances have been made in GIS interfaces and functionality however the concept of proximity or nearness, which is essential in many forms of human reasoning, is still being addressed insufficiently. This paper provides a thorough and comprehensive synthesis of the disparate literature that pertains to the subject of proximity. It offers insights into why existing methods for reasoning with proximity work, or do not work, and analyses their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the paper provides the derivation of new proximity measures, and their evaluation, backed by experiments and reflections. New measures are formally described in a unifying and compelling framework. This framework acknowledges that while distance is one factor that influences proximity perception, proximity is much more than just a distance measure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

328	This paper focuses on the potential impact of student-centered feedback for enhancing the learning experience of civil engineering students that used a geographic information system (GIS) based tutorial in a transportation engineering course. The tutorial was implemented in a laboratory environment developed as a self-guided activity supported by a web-based learning system. The formative research proposed in this study includes a series of four successive implementations of this laboratory. Students' performance, beliefs, and perceptions were monitored by using a mixed-methods design approach and weaknesses identified from early implementations were addressed before the next implementation of the laboratory activity. The students' performance was found to improve when the GIS web-based tutorial was complemented with an instructor-driven short introduction that anchored the laboratory activity in traffic safety. In addition, students' feedback in both quantitative and qualitative format indicated weaknesses related to the difficulty of the laboratory and usability factors such as speed and size of data uploading. As these weaknesses were addressed, students' positive input regarding the overall GIS laboratory experience significantly increased. This positive input was fully backed up by students' feedback indicating major strengths of the GIS laboratory for professional growth and future career development in civil and transportation engineering. Finally, students' inputs in the latest implementations provided valuable suggestions for future potential improvements regarding how to better integrate the GIS laboratory in course-related activities such as term projects.

329	The literature on neighborhoods and health highlights the difficulty of operationalizing \\neighborhood\\" in a conceptually and empirically valid manner. Most studies, however, continue to define neighborhoods using less theoretically relevant boundaries, risking erroneous inferences from poor measurement. We review an innovative methodology to address this problem, called the socio-spatial neighborhood estimation method (SNEM). To estimate neighborhood boundaries, researchers used a theoretically informed combination of qualitative GIS and on-the-ground observations in Texas City, Texas. Using data from a large sample, we assessed the SNEM-generated neighborhood units by comparing intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and multi-level model parameter estimates of SNEM-based measures against those for census block groups and regular grid cells. ICCs and criterion-related validity evidence using SF-36 outcome measures indicate that the SNEM approach to operationalization could improve inferences based on neighborhoods and health research.

331	This paper describes research to evaluate the use of a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) methodology for national park planning. Visitor perceptions of park experiences, environmental impacts, and facility needs were collected via an internet-based mapping method for input into a national park planning decision support system. The PPGIS method presupposes that consistent with the dominant statutory framework, national parks should be managed for both visitor enjoyment and natural and cultural resource protection. This paper: (1) describes the PPGIS method used in a 2009 park planning study conducted for national parks in the Greater Alpine region of Victoria, Australia; (2) presents and evaluates selected results of the Greater Alpine study and provides examples of how PPGIS data can be used for decision support in park planning; (3) provides a summary of lessons learned including a discussion of future implementation constraints. The results demonstrate that an internet, participatory mapping method, though not without limitations, can be effective in measuring visitor experiences, environmental impacts, and facility needs for a variety of park planning processes. PPGIS expands a park agency's repertoire of methods to engage the public in planning and can help build and sustain trust in a park agency's planning process and decisions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

332	Mapping technologies have made considerable strides in recent decades. Global positioning systems (GPS), remote sensing satellites, Web-based mapping services, and geographic information systems (GIS) have facilitated the collection, distribution, analysis, and ultimately interaction with geospatial information. In particular, portable GPS have altered how individuals participate in mapping. Individuals can use GPS to collect tracings of their personal interactions with the environment. These interactions can then be uploaded to one of many available Web-based mapping services. Once uploaded, the geospatial data can be mapped and shared among the broader community of users. Such volunteered geographic information (VGI) exemplifies the conceptualization of an individual collecting, mapping, and sharing personal geographic information. This paper focuses on challenges surrounding VGI. To help place these challenges in a broader context, specialized Web services and GPS technologies developed for the bicycling community will serve as examples of the current status and future prospects of VGI.	10.1559/15230406382258	WOS:000293875500003	2011	Volunteered Geographic Information
333	This article discusses some new ways in which social work research can explore the interaction between neighbourhoods and child and adult well-being. The authors note that social work practices are often criticised for taking an individualistic approach and paying too little attention to the service user's environment. The article uses examples of research projects from Chile, the USA and Wales, to discuss the use of spatially oriented research methods for understanding neighbourhood factors. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods approaches that are particularly appropriate for investigating social work-relevant topics are discussed in turn, including quantitative and qualitative uses for geographical information systems (GIS), hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) for analysing spatially clustered data and qualitative mobile interviews. The article continues with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of using spatially orientated research designs in social work research settings and concludes optimistically with suggestions for future directions in this area.	10.1093/bjsw/bcq123	WOS:000292803100005	2011	Understanding Neighbourhoods, Communities and Environments
334	This review considers two recent trajectories of research on the geospatial web: efforts to develop appropriate methodologies for working with the new forms of geographic information that are part of it, and studies of its cultural, social, and political significance. In both arenas, visualization and visual methods are central. I show how methodologies drawn from quantitative and qualitative approaches to geovisualization in GIScience offer productive ways of working with geoweb-based information in research, and examine recent efforts to use critical visual methods to study the geoweb as visual practice.	10.1177/0309132510374250	WOS:000290735700007	2011	Geographic Information Science
335	Social, economic, and ecological criteria contribute to the successful design, implementation, and management of marine protected areas (MPAs). In the context of California's Marine Life Protection Act Initiative, we developed a set of methods for collecting, compiling, and analyzing data about the spatial extent and relative economic importance of commercial and recreational fishing. We interviewed 174 commercial fishers who represented the major fisheries in the initiative's north-central coast region, which extends from Point Arena south to Pigeon Point. These fishers provided data that we used to map the extent of each of the fishing grounds, to weight the relative importance of areas within the grounds, to characterize the operating costs of each fishery, and to analyze the potential economic losses associated with proposed marine protected areas. A regional stakeholder group used the maps and impact analyses in conjunction with other data sets to iteratively identify economic and ecological trade-offs in designations of different areas as MPAs at regional, port, and fishery extents. Their final proposed MPA network designated 20% of state waters as MPAs. Potential net economic loss ranged from 1.7% to 14.2% in the first round of network design and totaled 6.3% in the final round of design. This process is a case study in the application of spatial analysis to validate and integrate local stakeholder knowledge in marine planning.	10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01626.x	WOS:000290491700011	2011	Incorporation of Spatial and Economic Analyses of Human-Use Data in the Design of Marine Protected Areas
336	Despite significant growth in public participation GIS (PPGIS) literature since the 1990s, little engagement by e-government scholars is evident in the extensive scholarly PPGIS debates. To fill this void, recent trends in PPGIS adoption by local governments are analyzed. Three waves of GIS are identified: desktop GIS, web GIS, and the Geospatial Web 2.0 platform. Such technological advancements have progressively eased GIS accessibility from expert users to ordinary citizens, accompanied by considerable growth in adopting PPGIS for traffic and transit, volunteered geographic information, and customer relationship management. However, limited use of PPGIS for higher levels of participation such as decision making is found. Barriers to PPGIS adoption for decision making seem less technological and more institutional.	10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02226.x	WOS:000290431100013	2011	Uses of Public Participation Geographic Information Systems Applications in E-Government
337	Following the Educational Reform Act of 1988, families in England and Wales have been free to identify a preferred school for their children's secondary education. However, as part of this open selection, the demand from parents opting to send their children to the best performing schools far outstrips the supply of available places at them, and consequently many schools ration places using entry criteria that favour those pupils domiciled close to the school. Through this geographic selection process, choice is spatially sorted and access to the best schools is often crucially dependent upon where parents live. After illustrating this problem, this paper develops an automated modelling technique that can be used to define and map school catchment areas based on the home locations of pupils attending every publically funded school in England. It then develops this framework to create a web based decision support tool to aid parents seeking secondary school places. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

338	With the rise of smart phones and ever more sophisticated handheld computers, many that now incorporate GPS (''sat nav'') technologies, there is tremendous potential for undertaking mixed-method research, including the collection of spatially referenced data. The increasing ubiquity and simplicity of mobile computing, as well as reduced cost, mean that the barriers to social scientists using these devices in the field have been significantly reduced. This article reports on two case studies using these technologies to investigate fear of crime and studentification. Participants generate spatial data simply by walking around an area, interacting with mobile devices through a simplistic interface. The resulting maps allow a more general spatial analysis of the issues to be undertaken, which can then be examined in more depth using qualitative data produced alongside the mobile computing activities. The article concludes that these approaches can be valuable in augmenting conventional qualitative data collection but emphasizes the importance of simple user interfaces both for participants and researcher.	10.1177/1525822X10388467	WOS:000289312100004	2011	Using GPS-Enabled Mobile Computing to Augment Qualitative Interviewing
339	Brazil has 109 million hectares of sustainable use reserves (SURs), most of them in Amazonia. In practical terms, SURs are being created to meet several objectives, but this process can and should be improved. The absence of a clear goal and the lack of basic social and biological information for such areas can compromise the goals, frustrate the people demanding the SURs and complicate the selection of the most adequate size, shape and category to be adopted. The data collection process used in the creation and management of protected areas is often compromised by under-funded environmental agencies, a lack of qualified human resources or the unawareness of accessible, quick, simple and inexpensive geographical methodologies able to facilitate such processes. The dissemination of tools and methods oriented to improve the management of and the decision-making process for protected areas in such adverse scenarios is necessary. Here we describe the execution of a participatory geographic information system (PGIS) to gain information on how human populations are living and using natural resources in the Maues State Forest, an SUR in Brazilian Amazonia. The PGIS allowed data acquisition for 415 families, 444 houses, 597 agricultural and animal-raising areas, 138 fishing sites, 106 hunting sites and 225 extraction sites within a short period of time (<than 20 days) and with accessible costs (<US$ 10,000). We classified and located the activities and points being used, the areas under stronger pressure and the hotspots for conservation, estimating that nearly 30% of the reserve was under direct use by its residents. We discuss the conservation implications of our findings and strongly recommend that the collection and mapping of socio-economic information should be prerequisite before the creation of any SURs in Brazilian Amazonia.

340	Social scientists have begun engaging with participants 'on the move' in a variety of ways. This paper presents the results of a pilot study, which deployed a qualitative GIS technique to analyse the effectiveness of walked interviews in capturing data relating to people's understanding of place. We give an account of the walking interview exploring two issues: the relationship between what people say and where they say it: and qualitative and quantitative differences between data generated by walking and sedentary interviews. Our results indicate that the data generated through walking interviews are profoundly informed by the landscapes in which they take place, emphasising the importance of environmental features in shaping discussions. We also demonstrate a measureable difference between walking and sedentary techniques in the production of rich place narratives both in terms of their quantity and spatial specificity to the study area. The paper concludes by acknowledging that a technocentric analysis of place runs the risk of emphasising locational above humanistic elements, but argues that, done sensitively, a qualitative GIS approach offers great potential for engaging planners and policy makers with the importance of local connections to place.

341	This article presents a methodology for designing a WebGIS framework intended for automatically analyzing spatial data and updating statistics of interest with new information inserted daily by multiple users via a Web portal. A practical example is used on vehicle accident data for assessing risk in specific road segments. Two main blocks integrated together will be described: the collaborative block and the data-analysis block. The former gives end-users computer-aided tools to view, insert, modify and manage data related to accidents and traffic monitoring sensors, whereas the latter is developed to automatically analyze the accident data coming from user's collaboration. Because different agencies can survey accident sites, a collaborative environment is necessary - and a Web-based solution is ideal - for permitting multi-user access and data insertion. A centralized approach to process the data in real time is described in all its components. Server-side Structured Query Language functions optimize performance by using dedicated libraries for spatial processing and re-structuring the attributes associated with elements which are consequently re-classified for correct color-scaling. The end-product is a system that provides a seamless integration of front-end tools for user collaboration and back-end tools to update accident risk statistics in real time and provide them to stakeholders.	10.1111/j.1467-9671.2011.01248.x	WOS:000292199100006	2011	Collaborative Web-GIS Design
348	Drawing on recent debates pointing to the value of mixed methods research in human geography, the authors revisit a quantitative location analysis model previously created to site palliative care services in rural British Columbia, Canada. The original quantitative model posited that population (i.e., number of residents in the community), isolation (i.e., travel time to existing specialized palliative care), and vulnerability (i.e., number of residents older than 65 years in the community) are three factors that must be accounted for when siting palliative care services in rural areas. Using qualitative interview data, the authors refine this model to include a newly identified factor: community readiness. They conclude with a discussion of the benefits of adopting a mixed methods approach to location analysis model development.	10.1177/1558689810385693	WOS:000285005800005	2011	Refining a Location Analysis Model Using a Mixed Methods Approach

342	This article suggests a framework for incorporating and communicating local perceptions of hurricane risk into policymaking through a case study conducted at El Zapotito commune in the State of Veracruz, Mexico. The authors constructed a geographical information system (GIS)-based model to quantify and spatially assess specific household-level vulnerabilities from information generated through interviews. This research developed a household vulnerability index applied to a participatory GIS to map vulnerability to hurricane hazard. The results indicate that infrastructural weaknesses are the most important factor contributing to vulnerability, explaining on their own 72.2% of the variation in the vulnerability patterns. These findings are corroborated by a vulnerability and capacity assessment (VCA), which shows that the community lacks strategies to cope with unsafe housing. It is suggested that linking community participation with modern techniques to analyse risk can empower communities and mobilise their capacities to address very specific vulnerabilities.

343	Urban planning processes are complex and multidimensional and they require re-thinking of traditional approaches. One of the theories increasingly researched by urban planners is realisation of participatory planning to facilitate public participation. This approach, as an effective bottom-up method, should increase the capabilities of planners to solve urban problems by including the general public in the urban planning process. This paper proposes a framework for a Web-based spatial decision support system (WebGIS-SDSS) adjusted to a participatory urban planning approach. The framework, called Web-based participatory urban planning (WPUP), has been implemented in a case study. It offers a Web-based spatial forum to demonstrate how the proposed system can not only help citizens to share their idea regarding urban plans, but also help planners to implement applicable bottom-up and public participation decision-making theory in the urban planning process. WPUP supports the deliberative and analytic components of the collaborative spatial decision-making process. It facilitates inclusion of local knowledge in urban planning to complement traditional approaches. WPUP provides easy access to urban plans and decisions, improves communication among planners and public, involves citizens' preferences on planning in a timely manner, and finally facilitates participatory planning approach.	10.1080/14498596.2011.623347	WOS:000306058400009	2011	A web-based spatial decision support system to enhance public participation in urban planning processes
344	One of the keys to environmental management is to understand the impact and interaction of people with natural resources as a means to improve human welfare and the consequent environmental sustainability for future generations. In terms of water management one of the on-going challenges is to assess what impact interventions in agriculture, and in particularly different irrigation strategies, will have on livelihoods and water resources in the landscape. Whilst global and national policy provide the overall vision of desired outcomes for environmental management, agricultural development and water use strategies they are often presented with local challenges to embed these policies in the reality on the ground, with different stakeholder groups. The concept that government agencies, advocacy organizations, and private citizens should work together to identify mutually acceptable solutions to environmental and water resource issues is increasing in prominence. Participatory spatial engagement techniques linked to geographic information systems (commonly termed participatory GIS (PGIS)) offers one solution to facilitate such stakeholder dialogues in an efficient and consultative manner. In the context of agricultural water management multi-scale PGIS techniques have recently been piloted as part of the 'Agricultural Water Management Solutions' project to investigate the current use and dependencies of water by small-holder farmers a watershed in Tanzania. The piloted approach then developed PGIS scenarios describing the effects on livelihoods and water resources in the watershed when introducing different management technologies. These relatively rapid PGIS multi-scale methods show promise for assessing current and possible future agriculture water management technologies in terms of their bio-physical and socio-economic impacts at the watershed scale. The paper discusses the development of the methodology in the context of improved water management decision making.

345	International discussions on the demand responsive approach (DRA) started in the mid-1990s because past supply-driven approaches had led to the failure of many water supply and sewerage/on-site sanitation (WS&S/OS) projects in developing countries (DCs). DRA has already been adopted in many WS&S/OS projects targeting a certain rural or poor urban area(s) by using various demand assessment techniques such as participatory rapid appraisal (PRA) to select optimum technical options. However, adoption of DRA in large-scale urban WS&S/OS projects (covering various areas of different socioeconomic groups with different needs) has been relatively delayed. Recently, the participatory geographic information system (PGIS) has emerged as an effective method of PRA, and high resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) has become commercially available. This paper presents a PGIS-based visual area categorization of different income groups using HRSI as a key for expediting the adoption of DRA to large-scale projects in DCs. This paper proposes an innovative pro-poor methodology of DRA for large-scale urban WS&S/OS projects. The methodology focuses on the improvement of multistage sampling in a household sample survey to plan mixed services suitable for various groups. The results of a partial application of the methodology in Pakistan are also presented.	10.2166/aqua.2011.081	WOS:000293348600004	2011	Innovative methodology of demand responsive approach for large-scale water supply and sewerage/on-site sanitation projects in developing countries using participatory GIS with high resolution satellite imagery
346	Studies have shown racial disparities in neighborhood access to healthy food in the United States. We used a mixed methods approach employing geographic information systems, focus groups, and a survey to examine African Americans' perceptions of the neighborhood nutrition environment in Pittsburgh. We found that African Americans perceive that supermarkets serving their community offer produce and meats of poorer quality than branches of the same supermarket serving White neighborhoods (p < 0.001). Unofficial taxis or jitneys, on which many African Americans are reliant, provide access from only certain stores; people are therefore forced to patronize these stores even though they are perceived to be of poorer quality. Community-generated ideas to tackle the situation include ongoing monitoring of supermarkets serving the Black community.

347	This article addresses an effort to incorporate wireless sensor networks and the emerging tools of the Geoweb into undergraduate teaching and research at a small liberal arts college. The primary goal of the research was to identify the hardware, software, and skill sets needed to deploy a local sensor network, collect data, and transmit that data over the Internet in a format that could be viewed and analyzed by an end user. A second goal of the project was to identify new skills and technologies that could be incorporated into existing GIS and computer science courses in order to better prepare students for the changing landscape of the Geoweb.	10.1080/00221341.2010.507777	WOS:000287210500005	2011	Teaching the Geoweb
350	This paper explores a technical solution (GIS-application) as a possible alternative for public participation in coastal decision-making. Through examination of a Scottish local case study, the paper examines the evidence that Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and more specifically Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS), can lead to or influence greater legitimacy in decision making in public participation in coastal management and waterfront development. Whilst demonstrating that GIS and PPGIS have considerable potential to provide the public with access to accurate data and factual information, to be able to integrate multiple and disparate data sources to allow merging of data, and to use various visualisation techniques, the complexities associated with PPGIS suggest that further research is required to establish if and how participatory GIS can increase legitimacy in a decision-making process.

351	This article proposes the use of content clouds as a method of exploratory qualitative data analysis. Content clouds are a type of visualisation that summarises the contents of a document by depicting the words that appear most often in larger, darker type within the cloud. When utilised as a form of qualitative GIS, content clouds provide a powerful way to summarise and compare information from different places on a single issue. Two examples using different types of documents and differently-scaled environmental issues demonstrate the possible utility of this method in summarising qualitative data and suggesting avenues for research.	10.1111/j.1475-4762.2010.00952.x	WOS:000283733100014	2010	Content clouds as exploratory qualitative data analysis
352	Health is increasingly understood as a product of multiple levels of influence, from individual biological and behavioral influences to community and societal level contextual influences. In understanding these contextual influences, community health researchers have increasingly employed both geographic methodologies, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and community participatory approaches. However, despite growing interest in the role for community participation and local knowledge in community health investigations, and the use of geographical methods and datasets in characterizing community environments, there exist few examples of research projects that incorporate both geographical and participatory approaches in addressing health questions. This is likely due in part to concerns and restrictions regarding community access to confidential health data. In order to overcome this barrier, we present a method for linking confidential, geocoded health information with community-generated experiential geographical information in a GIS environment. We use sophisticated disease mapping methodologies to create continuously defined maps of colorectal cancer in Iowa, then incorporate these layers in an open source GIS application as the context for a participatory community mapping exercise with participants from a rural Iowa town. Our method allows participants to interact directly with health information at a fine geographical scale, facilitating hypothesis generation regarding contextual influences on health, while simultaneously protecting data confidentiality. Participants are able to use their local, geographical knowledge to generate hypotheses about factors influencing colorectal cancer risk in the community and opportunities for risk reduction. This work opens the door for future efforts to integrate empirical epidemiological data with community generated experiential information to inform community health research and practice.	10.1007/s10900-010-9254-5	WOS:000284780200010	2010	Disease Maps as Context for Community Mapping
353	Objective: To analyse the association between childhood overweight and obesity and the density and proximity of fast food outlets in relation to the child's residential postcode. Design: This was an observational study using individual level height/weight data and geographic information systems methodology. Setting: Leeds in West Yorkshire, UK. This area consists of 476 lower super-output areas. Participants: Children aged 3-14 years who lived within the Leeds metropolitan boundaries (n=33,594). Main outcome measures: The number of fast food outlets per area and the distance to the nearest fast food outlet from the child's home address. The weight status of the child: overweight, obese or neither. Results: 27.1% of the children were overweight or obese with 12.6% classified as obese. There is a significant positive correlation (p < 0.001) between density of fast food outlets and higher deprivation. A higher density of fast food outlets was significantly associated (p=0.02) with the child being obese (or overweight/obese) in the generalised estimating equation model which also included sex, age and deprivation. No significant association between distance to the nearest fast food outlet and overweight or obese status was found. Conclusions: There is a positive relationship between the density of fast food outlets per area and the obesity status of children in Leeds. There is also a significant association between fast food outlet density and areas of higher deprivation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

354	A web-based collaborative-argumentation mapping experiment, which was used as part of a planning process in the city of Tampere, Finland, revealed a need for analytical tools to interpret the users' meaning making with this particular public participation GIS instrument. The main reason for this was the complexity of mediated interaction between different actors in and by means of the application: written comments, graphic symbols, and aerial photographs were combined to make meaning in particular context-specific situations. An analytical framework is discussed; it is shown to have the potential to grasp this type of signification process by studying the dynamics of different semiotic means and the production of discourse and settings in practice.	10.1068/b36002	WOS:000284720200010	2010	Ambiguities in knowledge production
355	This short article reviews and critically appraises Kingsbury and Jones' (2009) Geoforum article entitled \\Walter Benjamin's Dionysian Adventures on Google Earth\\", and finds it lacking in several regards. First, the use of Nietzsche's Dionysus/Apollo dichotomy is in fact a double binary, in which Apollonian logic is constructed as a binary within the dichotomy, while the Dionysian logic is 'bacchanalian'. Second, Walter Benjamin as exemplar of Dionysian logic is shown to be problematic and more a distraction from the flawed Nietzschean logic than a useful construct in itself. Lastly, the educational potential of Google Earth is overlooked by Kingsbury and Jones, in their haste to see Google Earth through 'Google goggles', in which everything Google appears through Dionysian-tinted lenses.

356	A variety of GIS-based collaborative decision support procedures exist that aim at involving the public in community planning and decision-making processes. Although the importance of consensus-building methods has been recognized in the collaborative decision support applications, there has been very little research addressing the problem of measuring consensus in the context of spatial collaborative decision-making. The main aim of this paper is to present an implementation of a consensus measuring procedure within WebGIS-based collaborative decision support tool. The collaborative tool, called Participatory-GIS.com, has been used for tackling a site-selection problem in the Town of Canmore, Alberta. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

357	Public participation is required in neighborhood infrastructure planning and problem-solving. Although Participatory GIS methods are considered important to help urban community groups identify problems and express their needs and concerns, usable means to help groups produce their maps remain difficult to be realised. Further, an effective means to facilitate the integration of government spatial plans and participatory maps also remains unclear. This article addresses usability issues in participatory mapping activities by exploring group collaboration mechanics and accomplishing use assessments. The study aims at testing the usefulness and the impact of participatory mapping for community development. User studies including questionnaire surveys, interviews, group usability testing, scenario assessments, and the scaling-up activity were executed. Transparent photomaps, Mobile GIS, and a Web map were implemented and assessed in the study area. A use scenario for community and official spatial data integration was also developed. The results of user studies show that the use of transparent photomaps is more effective to complete group tasks to discuss, draw, and annotate their infrastructure problems. For group participants, the transparent maps are more engaging, easy to learn, and more error tolerant than the use of Mobile GIS. A combination use of simple and advanced PGIS methods is necessary to be implemented to reach informed priority-decision making.	10.1111/j.1467-9671.2010.01206.x	WOS:000292154400008	2010	Usability Issues in Applying Participatory Mapping for Neighborhood Infrastructure Planning
358	Excavations are easy in the soft, unconsolidated sediments of Bangladesh and are widespread for the creation of raised, flood-free homestead platforms. Small water bodies form in the resulting hollows and are used for fisheries, livestock management, irrigation, bathing and washing clothes. Despite their importance to everyday life, there is no up-to-date inventory or monitoring. The paper uses remote sensing, GIS and a number of qualitative data collection techniques to reconstruct the pattern of small water bodies in Shahjadpur thana. It concludes that there has been an expansion in their number, but no systematic planning of their use.	10.1111/j.1475-4762.2009.00909.x	WOS:000277320900010	2010	Small water bodies in Bangladesh
359	Sustainable development and successful urban regeneration ideally require engagement with the affected communities. Existing methods employed by policymakers and planners often fail to reach significant segments of communities, the so-called 'hard-to-reach'. This paper describes the development of an innovative participatory GIS methodology specifically aimed at overcoming the barriers to engagement experienced by these groups. The application of the method is illustrated with reference to three recent case studies carried out in UK cities. The paper will then discuss the novelty of this approach in comparison with other participatory engagement techniques. The ethical implications of the technique are also discussed.	10.1111/j.1475-4762.2009.00912.x	WOS:000277320900012	2010	How to reach the 'hard-to-reach'
360	Recent advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Web 2.0 technologies provide new ways of creating sophisticated Web applications that strengthen social interactions based on comments on online maps, which have the potential to improve Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) practices. In this paper, we address this promising approach to analyze the impact of collaborative Web 2.0 tools applied to PPGIS applications in urban planning actions. We develop a Web 2.0 PPGIS application through free, easy-to-use tools, which consist of a Web mapping service, with eligible geospatial data layers, where users explore and comment. A database stores the contributions in a format supported by GIS. We also set up a prototype version in Canela (Brazil), to test its usability. The results showed that it is a valuable approach for engaging the public. It could promote communication among users and decision makers in a more interactive and straightforward way. Besides, it is easy to set up and understandable by non-experts. The Web 2.0 PPGIS may serve as a social tool for any spatially-related issue involving community members in any context.

361	This essay describes an effort to create a user-friendly Geographic Information Systems (GIS) map of historic and contemporary Indian allotment lands in Plumas and Lassen counties. Because of the nonratification of treaties with California tribes, most unrecognized Mountain Maidu do not see themselves spatially represented despite their collective presence. By appropriating tools of representation (maps), and assimilation (allotments), the act of mapping allotments resists the attempted political and spatial erasure of unrecognized California Indians. As allotments continue to change hands today-via hydroelectric and timber projects, conservation initiatives, and housing developments-knowing their location is important for protecting cultural resources and for asserting the significance of Maidu participation in environmental stewardship. A GIS layer of Indian allotment lands in Plumas and Lassen counties, linked to quantitative and qualitative information from allotment files, offers a multileveled understanding of allotments. The mapping process engages dialogues in Participatory GIS (PGIS) and place-making, and raises key questions of power, representation, accessibility, and knowledge. The historic and contemporary contexts for mapping are addressed, and PGIS is evaluated as a tool for liberatory research with community groups.	10.1215/00141801-2010-002	WOS:000279523100002	2010	Seeking Spatial Representation
362	This review examines emerging research on the geoweb, particularly recent efforts to assess the social, political and disciplinary shifts associated with it. The rise of the geoweb is associated with shifts in the processes and power relations of spatial data creation and use, reconfigurations in previously bounded disciplinary knowledge sets, and shifts in the subjectivities and social relations that are produced through the geoweb's technologies, data, and practices. This early research on the societal implications of the geoweb is drawing productively upon conceptual frameworks from critical GIS, public participation GIS, and spatial data infrastructure research, but must also theorize beyond these existing bodies of work.	10.1177/0309132509340711	WOS:000278757300004	2010	Geographic information science

363	Background: Extensive public health gains have benefited high-income countries in recent decades, however, citizens of low and middle-income countries (LMIC) have largely not enjoyed the same advancements. This is in part due to the fact that public health data - the foundation for public health advances - are rarely collected in many LMIC. Injury data are particularly scarce in many low-resource settings, despite the huge associated burden of morbidity and mortality. Advances in freely-accessible and easy-to-use information and communication (ICT) technology may provide the impetus for increased public health data collection in settings with limited financial and personnel resources. Methods and Results: A pilot study was conducted at a hospital in Cape Town, South Africa to assess the utility and feasibility of using free (non-licensed), and easy-to-use Social Web and GeoWeb tools for injury surveillance in low-resource settings. Data entry, geocoding, data exploration, and data visualization were successfully conducted using these technologies, including Google Spreadsheet, Mapalist, BatchGeocode, and Google Earth. Conclusion: This study examined the potential for Social Web and GeoWeb technologies to contribute to public health data collection and analysis in low-resource settings through an injury surveillance pilot study conducted in Cape Town, South Africa. The success of this study illustrates the great potential for these technologies to be leveraged for public health surveillance in resource-constrained environments, given their ease-of-use and low-cost, and the sharing and collaboration capabilities they afford. The possibilities and potential limitations of these technologies are discussed in relation to the study, and to the field of public health in general.	10.1186/1476-072X-9-25	WOS:000279212600001	2010	Injury surveillance in low-resource settings using Geospatial and Social Web technologies
364	Travel to and from school is a regular part of life for most children. Such movement can also have important social, economic, and environmental implications, both for individuals and for wider society. This paper uses innovative methods to examine the complexity of the school journey, and to relate it to exposure to air pollution and engagement with the environment through which children pass. Some thirty lower secondary school pupils used mobile-phone and global positioning system technology to record their routes to and from school in four study periods. They were asked to take photographs and write text messages relating to their route, and these data were then linked to modelled air pollution on the routes through which pupils travelled. Results demonstrate that for most children the journey to and from school is highly variable and contingent on other factors. Pupils who travelled independently (on foot, by bicycle, or by bus) were most likely to engage with their immediate environment, and small variations in route choice had significant effects on their cumulative exposure to air pollution. It is argued that the results shed new light on the everyday experience of the school journey, and have implications for health promotion and transport planning in towns.	10.1068/a41405	WOS:000277931200014	2010	Understanding the school journey
365	The oceans are not only being transformed through privatization as management moves towards market mechanisms, the oceans are also being \\zoned\\", with zoning increasingly proposed as the ideal conduit for weighting different uses of the ocean This is concomitant with a move towards ecosystem-based management that also partakes in a policy environment imbued with the commodification of nature, in which environmental services are ranked and valued according to neoliberal percept.  Crucial to these projects are the utilization of GIS technologies This paper considers these zones of preservation and sites of conflict through an ethnographic case study of (lie scallop fisheries of New England, examining conflicts between harvesters, different projects to map the fishery, and ongoing efforts to reseed scallop beds The paper explores how participants themselves articulate the changing practices of fishing and farming, redefining boundaries of nature and Culture. While reseeding projects, for example, arguably participate in the market logic of neoliberalism, at the same time they may resist and redefine the terms, as communities see themselves sowing the seeds of their own sustainability and changing the terms of what Counts, literally, as nature Published by Elsevier Ltd"	10.1016/j.geoforum.2009.10.008	WOS:000275811400014	2010	Seeding nature, ceding culture
366	A number of approaches for integrating GIS and qualitative research have emerged in recent years, as part of a resurgence of interest in mixed methods research in geography. These efforts to integrate qualitative data and qualitative analysis techniques complement a longstanding focus in GIScience upon ways of handling qualitative forms of spatial data and reasoning in digital environments, and extend engagements with 'the qualitative' in GIScience to include discussions of research methodologies. This article contributes to these emerging qualitative GIS methodologies by describing the structures and functions of 'computer-aided qualitative GIS' (CAQ-GIS), an approach for storing and analyzing qualitative, quantitative, and geovisual data in both GIS and computer aided data analysis software. CAQ-GIS uses modified structures from conventional desktop GIS to support storage of qualitative data and analytical codes, together with a parallel coding and analysis process carried out with GIS and a computer-aided data analysis software package. The inductive mixed methods analysis potential of CAQ-GIS is demonstrated with examples from research on children's urban geographies.	10.1111/j.1467-9671.2009.01182.x	WOS:000292151400004	2010	Extending the Qualitative Capabilities of GIS
367	As the obesity epidemic in children increases, it is important to consider the role of neighborhoods in supporting children's physical activity and healthy development, especially in low-income communities where obesity levels among children are higher than for their middle-income counterparts. I present a participatory and qualitative GIS approach to mapping children's own perceptions and use of their neighborhood for physical activity with ten and eleven year-olds growing up in a diverse low-income community in Denver, CO. Girls walk shorter distances to and use different types of community spaces for play and recreation from boys, some of which is explained by the differing environmental-socialization approaches employed by parents and carers. Children's perceptions of risk align spatially with features of the built environment, but do not correlate with reported crime. Results illustrate the utility of qualitative spatial analysis to understand relationships between children's perception, the built environment, and social factors that shape children's active transport, leisure, and recreation in their neighborhood. Children's local knowledge should be valued and solicited in community-level health and planning interventions to promote physical activity.	10.1068/b35002	WOS:000275483200009	2010	A qualitative GIS approach to mapping urban neighborhoods with children to promote physical activity and child-friendly community planning
369	To increase the monitoring potential of forest fires, an alert classification methodology using satellite-mapped hotspots has been established to help forest managers in the prioritization of which hotspot to be verified in the field, thus potentially improving the distribution of fire-fighting resources. A computer application was developed based on web-distributed geographical information technology whose main function is to interact automatically generated satellite hotspots and risk areas indicated in fire-susceptibility maps and classify them into five alert levels. The location of the hotspots is available continuously every 4 h, and a susceptibility map is produced daily through map algebra algorithm, which uses static (topography, vegetation and land use) and dynamic (weather) variables. Every process runs through automated geoprocessing routines. The methodology was tested during the dry period of 2007 in the Carajas National Forest, in the Brazilian Amazon, within an area of 400,000 ha. It is a critical area constantly threatened by fires caused by invasions and deforestation owing to intense agribusiness advances and mining activities in its surroundings. This situation results in observations of many hotspots inside the study area for the same day and almost the same time period, in places of extreme opposites, demanding complex rapid analysis and hindering the decision of the displacement of fire-fighting teams. Further, a major mining company operates within the National Forest area, maintaining actions of protection as part of its environmental mining license. Results are presented under three aspects: (i) the credibility of the daily susceptibility map (algorithm), which showed strong correlation between areas of greatest risks and the confirmed forest fires; (ii) the reliability of hotspots (alert levels), confirming 71% of fires; (iii) accuracy in the decision of which hotspot to be checked, which revealed the same number of verifications at different alert levels, 82% confirmed alert 5 hotspots (maximum) and only 50% from alert 1 (minimum), resulting in faster fire-fighting actions, minimizing burned areas and, in some cases, allowing fire control before its spreading. Therefore, the methodology demonstrated that GIS routines are able to determine the relationship between a reality-based, interpreted susceptibility map of the area and satellite-generated hotspots, highlighting the ones of highest hazard level through the alert classification, becoming an important tool to help decisions from the fire-control center, especially for high-risk regions. The methodology may be extrapolated to other forested areas.	10.1080/13658810903194264	WOS:000276747400005	2010	Forest Fire Alert System
370	Citizen science websites are emerging as a common way for volunteers to collect and report geographic ecological data. Engaging the public in citizen science is challenging and, when involving online participation, data entry, and map use, becomes even more daunting. Given these new challenges, citizen science websites must be easy to use, result in positive overall satisfaction for many different users, support many different tasks, and ensure data quality. To begin reaching these goals, we built a geospatially enabled citizen science website, evaluated its usability, and gained experience by working with and listening to citizens using the website. We sought to determine general perceptions, discover potential problems, and iteratively improve website features. Although the website was rated positively overall, map-based tasks identified a wide range of problems. Given our results, we redesigned the website, improved the content, enhanced the ease of use, simplified the map interface, and added features. We discuss citizen science websites in relation to online Public Participation Geographic Information Systems, examine the role(s) websites may play in the citizen science research model, discuss how citizen science research advances GIScience, and offer guidelines to improve citizen-based web mapping applications.	10.1080/13658816.2010.490532	WOS:000284637100005	2010	User-friendly web mapping
371	Tools that support public engagement with sustainability are essential for local sustainability planning. This research investigates the ability of two geographic information system (GIS)-based tools to promote discussion of sustainability in a suburban context. A local ecological footprint tool and a community environmental atlas (an environmentally themed online mapping system) were created for seven suburban boroughs of Montreal. Variations of both tools have been used to support sustainability efforts, but their use has not been widely evaluated. Working from a public participation GIS (PPGIS) framework that recognizes the powerful influence of data representation, this research uses focus groups to evaluate how well these tools address three criteria that have emerged from the literature on public engagement in sustainability: interdependency across systems, reflexivity about personal and social decision making, and interactions across spatial scales. Whereas the atlas remains advantageous for discussing local spatial specifics, it was found that the ecological footprint helped people see the interconnections among systems, integrate local and global aspects of sustainability, and reflect on the values and assumptions underlying current social and economic structures.	10.1080/00330120903404892	WOS:000273406100006	2010	Connecting Local to Global
372	The authors describe how we are harnessing the power of web 2.0 technologies to create new approaches to collecting, mapping, and sharing geocoded data. The authors begin with GMapCreator that lets users fashion new maps using Google Maps as a base. The authors then describe MapTube that enables users to archive maps and demonstrate how it can be used in a variety of contexts to share map information, to put existing maps into a form that can be shared, and to create new maps from the bottom-up using a combination of crowdcasting, crowdsourcing, and traditional broadcasting. The authors conclude by arguing that such tools are helping to define a neogeography that is essentially \\mapping for the masses,'' while noting that there are many issues of quality, accuracy, copyright, and trust that will influence the impact of these tools on map-based communication."	10.1177/0894439309332299	WOS:000270984300006	2009	Mapping for the Masses Accessing Web 2.0 Through Crowdsourcing
373	The article explores qualitative geography and qualitative social science as sites of mixed methods research practice. The authors argue that there is an emergent convergence of methodologies and analytical purposes between qualitative geography and qualitative social science. The authors show how methodological and analytical convergence has been enabled by technological convergence between geographical information systems (GIS) and qualitative software (CAQDAS). The argument is illustrated by examples of convergent geo-referenced mixed methods studies, including a main example from research on reproductive health in Paraguay.	10.1177/1558689809344973	WOS:000272046600004	2009	CAQDAS-GIS Convergence Toward a New Integrated Mixed Method Research Practice?

374	Background: Measures to assess neighborhood environments are needed to better understand the salient features that may enhance outdoor physical activities, such as walking and bicycling for transport or leisure. The purpose of this study was to derive constructs to describe neighborhoods using both primary (neighborhood audit) and secondary (geographic information systems) data. Methods: We collected detailed information on 10,770 road segments using an audit and secondary data. The road segment sample was randomly split into an exploratory (60%) and validation sample (40%) for cross-validation. Using the exploratory sample (n = 6,388), seven a priori constructs were assessed separately (functionality, safety, aesthetics, destinations, incivilities, territorality, social spaces) by urbanicity using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Additionally, new a posteriori constructs were derived using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). For cross-validation (n = 4,382), we tested factor loadings, thresholds, correlated errors, and correlations among a posteriori constructs between the two subsamples. Two-week test-retest reliability of the final constructs using a subsample of road segments (n = 464) was examined using Spearman correlation coefficients. Results: CFA indicated the a priori constructs did not hold in this geographic area, with the exception of physical incivilities. Therefore, we used EFA to derive a four-factor solution on the exploratory sample: arterial or thoroughfare, walkable neighborhood, physical incivilities, and decoration. Using CFA on the validation sample, the internal validity for these a posteriori constructs was high (range 0.43 to 0.73) and the fit was acceptable. Spearman correlations indicated the arterial or thoroughfare factor displayed near perfect reliability in both urban and rural segments (r = 0.96). Both the physical incivilities factor and the walkable neighborhood factor had substantial to near perfect reliability in both urban and rural segments (r = 0.77 to 0.78 and r = 0.79 to 0.82, respectively). The decoration factor displayed moderate reliability in urban segments (r = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.38-0.60) and lower reliability in rural segments (r = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.25-0.52). Conclusion: The results of our analyses yielded four reliably and objectively measured constructs that will be used to explore associations with physical activity in urban and rural North Carolina. These constructs should be explored in other geographic areas to confirm their usefulness elsewhere.	10.1186/1479-5868-6-44	WOS:000209560300001	2009	Assessing urban and rural neighborhood characteristics using audit and GIS data
375	Significant advances in public participation geographic information systems technology and online mapping platforms have not translated into enhanced citizen participation in democratic planning processes. This study contributes to addressing this gap by evaluating the engagement of members of an urban community in sustainable neighbourhood planning through argumentation mapping. The study provided an online public discussion forum, together with a neighbourhood map to which the participants could link their discussion contributions. On the basis of participation statistics, contents of contributions, and responses to a survey, we discuss the participants' technical and engagement experiences. The sixteen registered participants lived within or near the 'Queen West Triangle' in downtown Toronto, Canada. They rated themselves as experienced computer users and consequently found the participation in the online discussion forum to be easy.

376	This paper argues, following Friedrich Nietzsche, that recent evaluations of Google Earth uncritically privilege the product's Apollonian determinations at the expense of its Dionysian uncertainties. Specifically, when we understand Google Earth as a virtual globe composed of surveyed panoramas, sober rationalization, dystopic control, and transparent order - or, even, as a tool for participation and empowerment we undersell its capacities as an alluring digital peep-box, an uncertain orb spangled with vertiginous paranoia, frenzied navigation, jubilatory dissolution, and intoxicating giddiness. We argue that the former interpretations not only risk foreclosing our theorizations about how Google Earth is actually used in various ways and different contexts, they also reproduce a one-dimensional and conservative reading of technology that can be traced back (at least) to the writings of Theodor Adorno. By drawing on the work of Walter Benjamin (Adorno's critic and pen pal for more than a decade) we aim to 'go beyond Apollo and Adorno' by illustrating the extent to which Apollonian order and Dionysian love makes Google Earth go round. To do this, we examine Google Earth as a \\digital peep-box\\" with an online collective that revels in its \\"Spot the Black Helicopter\\" competitions  illuminated profanities  alien and giant insect invaders  naked sunbathers and crashed transport planes in Darfur.

377	Critical GIS (CGIS) is an approach to evaluating GIS technology that draws upon multiple intellectual tool kits-from geography, social theory and computing science. While its roots are in the battles between human geographers and GIScientists in the 1990s, CGIS has emerged as an independent, constructive approach to enhancing the power and appeal of GIS. CGIS is also beginning to gain acceptance as a legitimate component of the broad tent that is GIScience. This short article reviews the emergence of CGIS, discusses its influence on the discipline of GIScience and finally explores the state of CGIS in Canada.

378	Community integration research explores community contexts and factors that encourage or hinder individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) from actively participating in community life. This research agenda can be advanced by using mixed-methods that better document the relationships between contextual factors and individual experience. Two such methods were applied to a mixedmethods study of 40 adults with SMI living in independent housing in the Southeastern United States. Their contextualized experiences of community integration were measured by applying innovative participatory mapping and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping techniques. Use of these methods in conjunction with one another facilitated the creation of activity spaces, which can measure geographic accessibility and help to represent an individual's experience of place and degree of mobility. The utility of these newly applied methods for better understanding community integration for persons with SMI is explored and implications for using these measures in research and practice are discussed.

379	This article discusses the potential of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to become an information technology enabling groups of people to participate in decisions shaping their communities and promoting sustainable use of natural resources. It explains the concept of participation in the context of planning and decision making. In this context Participatory GIS (PGIS) offers tools that can be used to help the public become meaningfully involved in decision making processes affecting their communities. Following an overview of research on PGIS and its current status the article presents two recent studies of PGIS in water resource planning: one involving the use of computer generated maps representing simple information structures and the other involving the use of more sophisticated information tools. The synthesis of both studies provides the bases for discussing the prospects of PGIS to empower citizens in making decisions about their communities and resources. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

380	In spatial planning and environmental management, maps are found very helpful in many Situations, but in other situations they may also deepen conflicts or be ignored. This paper addresses the question what explains Such phenomena, with particular emphasis on, and reference to, collaborative policymaking settings in the Netherlands. We have elaborated the concept of 'frames' and 'framing' to structure and analyze the function of maps in the context of deliberative policymaking. With help of discourse analysis, a method adopted from the policy sciences, we have observed ongoing multi-actor processes and focused on discussions around maps in several case studies. From the observations of both the maps themselves and the discussions and actions with the maps, we have interpreted the meaning and frames represented 'in' the map images, as well as the various perspectives of actors 'on' the collaborative use of the map. We have conceptualized three fundamentally different perspectives or frames on the function of maps in the decision-making process. The cross-frame debate over maps is illustrated with the recollection of one particular map-making example. We conclude that the conflicts observed in a number of case Studies can be adequately explained with help of the three identified frames, and provide some recommendations for the profession of mapping.

382	The effectiveness of a decision-support tool created to identify protected-area potential within the Nova Forest Alliance (NFA) of Nova Scotia, Canada is assessed from the perspective of a public participatory geographic information system (PPGIS) approach. The application sought to create an integrated GIS-based decision-support tool for community-focused communication and conservation assessment among NFA partners (including private woodland owners, government agencies, forest companies, and non-government organizations) and potential application within other model forests in Canada. The application illustrated that the GIS-based tool, once set up and Populated with the necessary data, was able to generate effective visual alternatives to support decision making within the NFA community and elsewhere. However, from a PPGIS perspective, the application faced challenges that influenced the efficacy of its implementation: (1) limitations arose around data quality, use and sharing policies; (2) although opportunities for participation by the NFA partnership were initiated, these proved insufficient to achieve adequate engagement, buy in and Support for the process and outcomes; and (3) the expert-grounded GIS-based tool requires a greater degree of expertise than may currently be present in the community. These challenges limit its ongoing use in the NFA and its potential utility in other model forests. For PPGIS-decision-support applications to be effective in the NFA and elsewhere, it is suggested that the following conditions be met: (1) implementation of geographically based data policies to allow for greater data accessibility, specifically with fewer bureaucratic and private sector barriers: (2) engagement of community partners in the initial project design, goal-setting and subsequent stages, even if this requires extensions to anticipated timelines; and (3) development of effective participatory technical systems that meet the needs of participants without being so complex as to constitute a barrier to their use.

383	Cinema-going is a cultural experience shaped by logistics and mobility, as film distributors and exhibitors operate to enable films to be screened in places and at times when audiences can physically assemble to view them together A historical understanding of the geography of cinema distribution, exhibition and attendance can therefore help its to understand what factors other than the choice of film title may have shaped the experience of the cinema audience. This article uses samples of trade commentary on small country cinemas in the late 1920s from the Australian trade journal Everyones, and suggests that historical GIS maps could help its to understand regional differences in the cinema-going experience, or track phenomena such as the diffusion of racial and social segregation in cinemas. Nevertheless, we need to remain mindful of the limits of maps to adequately explain the cultural experience of encountering these phenomena.	NA	WOS:000266386200009	2009	Limit of Maps?
384	The lack of solid footing in political space is what makes the human rights claims of refugees most vulnerable in the contemporary international order. However, modem international human rights law and protection are predicated on a spatialised sense of the subject of rights that is formed in opposition to and in exclusion of the refugee. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) seeks to locate refugees as part of the universe of human rights through refugee registration exercises; it attempts to map their displacement within the geography of emplaced citizenry. Its conventional efforts in this regard fail, though, and, rather, serve to illustrate how the informal international movement of refugees still exceeds and, thus, undermines the universalism of the UN vision of human rights and freedoms. Consequently, the UNHCR has recently resorted to the highly sophisticated computerised registration technology, called proGres, under its Project Profile system. While the detail and complexity of Project Profile allow for a mapping no more capable of accurately tracing the movements of refugees within the global geography of universal human rights, the complex of digitalised mapping systems brought together within Project Profile permit the production and performance of an international space in which humanitarians may expect refugees to fit. The force of the UNHCR`s new registration system is to produce a manner of spatialising refugees that can legitimate and moralise their constraint within orders of international politics and security which allow little room for response to the rights claims of refugees. Rather, their claims to human rights become foreclosed within a virtual understanding of human displacement with respect to emplacement in the state.	10.1068/d6807	WOS:000265814800012	2009	Refugee registration as foreclosure of the freedom to move

388	This study examines the potential socio-spatial impacts of a new series of marine protected areas (MPAs) on fishers in Moorea, French Polynesia. The establishment of the MPAs is contextualized within recent and historical processes of economic development and theories of women in development and gender, culture and development. Seventy adults from three neighborhoods in Moorea were interviewed. Analysis of the data provides new information about the characteristics of fishing in Moorea. Unlike most fishing cultures and communities throughout the Pacific Islands, men and women in Moorea have similar, as opposed to segregated, spatial patterns of fishing activities and fishing methods. The study also points out the potential negative impacts of the MPAs on both men and women, particularly younger and lower-income fishers.	10.1080/09663690903003983	WOS:000269670600007	2009	Economic development, marine protected areas and gendered access to fishing resources in a Polynesian lagoon
389	Rainfall erosivity is a major causal factor of soil erosion, and it is included in many prediction models. Maps of rainfall erosivity indices are required for assessing soil erosion at the regional scale. In this study a comparison is made between several techniques for mapping the rainfall erosivity indices: i) the RUSLE R factor and ii) the average EI(30) index of the erosive events over the Ebro basin (NE Spain). A spatially dense precipitation data base with a high temporal resolution (15 min) was used. Global, local and geostatistical interpolation techniques were employed to produce maps of the rainfall erosivity indices, as well as mixed methods. To determine the reliability of the maps several goodness-of-fit and error statistics were computed, using a cross-validation scheme, as well as the uncertainty of the predictions, modeled by Gaussian geostatistical simulation. All methods were able to capture the general spatial pattern of both erosivity indices. The semivariogram analysis revealed that spatial autocorrelation only affected at distances of similar to 15 km around the observatories. Therefore, local interpolation techniques tended to be better overall considering the validation statistics. All models showed high uncertainty, caused by the high variability of rainfall erosivity indices both in time and space, what stresses the importance of having long data series with a dense spatial coverage.

390	The cadastre is an infrastructure of institutions, humans, and nonhumans. Its role in governance is the provision of a systematic organization of land ownership, rights, and responsibilities. The cadastral infrastructure's information needs to correspond to actual uses of land if it is to be of continued use in governance. In effect, as an important governmental information space, it needs to also correspond to geographic and social spaces. For many reasons the boundary objects making up the cadastral infrastructure can be unstable-delays in processing changes and conflicting competencies are commonplace. Larger instabilities including civil unrest, war, and persistent corruption produce profound asymmetries and distortions. Following centuries of disruption, ongoing attempts to augment cadastral infrastructures in post-socialist Central and Eastern Europe offer opportunities to probe and analyze the stabilization of cadastral infrastructures. Poland, which never saw complete collectivization and retained a cadastral infrastructure, offers an exemplary cadastral infrastructure for study, with its uniqueness bringing out many tensions still nascent in neighboring countries.	10.1080/01972240903212623	WOS:000274301100004	2009	Of Boundary Objects and Boundaries

392	Recent attempts to integrate geographic information systems (GIS) and participatory techniques, have given rise to terminologies such as participatory GIS and community-integrated GIS. Although GIS was initially developed for physical geographic application, it can be used for the management and analysis of health and health care data. Geographic information, systems, combined with participatory methodology, have facilitated the analysis of access to health facilities and disease risk in different populations. Little has been, published about the usefulness of combining participatory methodologies and GIS technology in an effort to understand and inform, community-based intervention studies, especially in. the context of HIV This article attempts to address this perceived gap in the literature.

394	Heated exchanges between critical theorists and GIScientists over geographic information systems ( GIS) in 1990s geography gave rise to calls for increased communication between critics and practitioners of the technology and most recently for \\hybrid\\" qualitative-quantitative GIS practices. Although GIS scholars have successfully addressed mid-1990s critiques of the technology by developing a series of critical GIS practices that involve nuanced and reflexive deployments of GIS and assessments of its visual products, theoretical critiques of GIS remain fixated on the epistemological deficiencies of the technology. Despite references to loosening metaphysical tensions across the discipline, this difference in assessments reveals the discourses of critical-theoretic geography and GIScience to remain separated by a trenchant philosophical divide, across which ontological and epistemological commitments are inviolable. The inability to fully reconcile a critical-theoretic epistemology with the explicitly ontological metaphysics of GIS further complicates qualitative engagements with the technology by addressing a series of inconsistencies into GIS praxis arising from the quantitative limits to representation encountered in the formal universe of computing. The persistence of metaphysical tensions in critical engagements with the technology questions the degree to which qualitative methods can be seamlessly hybridized with the quantitative architectures of GIS."	10.1080/00330120902932026	WOS:000270526600007	2009	Quantitative Limits to Qualitative Engagements
395	Context. Some species that are perceived by certain stakeholders as a valuable resource can also cause ecological or economic damage, leading to contrasting management objectives and subsequent conflict between stakeholder groups. There is increasing recognition that the integration of stakeholder knowledge with formal scientific data can enhance the information available for use in management. This is especially true where scientific understanding is incomplete, as is frequently the case for wide-ranging species, which can be difficult to monitor directly at the landscape scale. Aims. The aim of the research was to incorporate stakeholder knowledge with data derived from formal quantitative models to modify predictions of wildlife distribution and abundance, using wild deer in the UK as an example. Methods. We use selected predictor variables from a deer-vehicle collision model to estimate deer densities at the 10-km square level throughout the East of England. With these predictions as a baseline, we illustrate the use of participatory GIS as a methodological framework for enabling stakeholder participation in the refinement of landscape-scale deer abundance maps. Key results. Stakeholder participation resulted in modi. cations to modelled abundance patterns for all wild deer species present in the East of England, although the modi. cations were minor and there was a high degree of consistency among stakeholders in the adjustments made. For muntjac, roe and fallow deer, the majority of stakeholder changes represented an increase in density, suggesting that populations of these species are increasing in the region. Conclusions. Our results show that participatory GIS is a useful technique for enabling stakeholders to contribute to incomplete scientific knowledge, especially where up-to-date species distribution and abundance data are needed to inform wildlife research and management. Implications. The results of the present study will serve as a valuable information base for future research on deer management in the region. The flexibility of the approach makes it applicable to a range of species at different spatial scales and other wildlife conflict issues. These may include the management of invasive species or the conservation of threatened species, where accurate spatial data and enhanced community involvement are necessary in order to facilitate effective management.	10.1071/WR08153	WOS:000271192800001	2009	Mapping wildlife
396	Previous soil lead studies in New Orleans focused on the geochemical footprint and its health impacts. This study examines the human geography of race, income, and age in pre-Katrina metropolitan New Orleans within the context of lead accumulation in soils. Sample points of soil lead data (n = 5,467) collected in 1998-2000 were mapped in a geographic information system (GIS), binned into 9 ranges, and queried by (1) 2000 Census racial demographic data, (2) 1999 median household income, and (3) 2000 age data. The absolute population generally declines as lead levels increase except at lead levels from 200-400 to 400-1,000 mg/kg when population increases; the African-American population comprises a disproportionate share of this cohort. The high-lead areas occur in the inner city, home to the largest populations of African-Americans in New Orleans. The mean household income curve indicates that lower economic groups are at risk to higher levels of lead. A total of 44,701 children under the age of 5 years, plus 123,579 children aged 5-17, lived in census block groups containing at least one sample point with over 100 mg/kg lead, and these include 23,124 and 64,064 young people, respectively, who live near at least one point over 400 mg/kg. Lead exposure affects a panoply of outcomes that influence the health and welfare of the community. Unless corrected, children are likely to return to the same or, because of lack of lead-safe practices during renovation, even higher exposure risks than before the flooding of New Orleans.	10.1007/s10653-008-9190-9	WOS:000260262900005	2008	Human geography of New Orleans' high-lead geochemical setting

400	This paper examines the increasing use of geographic information systems (GIS) to support the project of 'collaborative' planning. Specifically, I explore the ways in which the use of GIS in collaborative planning programs works to counteract and/or reproduce patterns of marginalization always present in local political struggles. Through a review of the literature and an analysis of a case study of the use of GIS in rural water resource management, I argue that the discourse and practices of collaboration can often lead to a problematic depoliticization of GIS. Furthermore, I show how this depoliticization can normalize both uneven power dynamics and the marginalization of alternative and oppositional perspectives. I employ this case study as a backdrop to propose an alternative practice of participatory GIS motivated by Mouffe's notion of 'agonistic pluralism'. This practice of agonistic participatory GIS is designed to foreground, rather than obscure, the politics of spatial knowledge production by explicitly juxtaposing alternative understandings of space and spatial problems. I conclude by discussing the importance of this work to the critical and participatory GIS research agendas.	10.1068/a4028	WOS:000260700700005	2008	A call for agonism
402	One of the greatest challenges facing mountain scholars is to separate environmental change caused by human activities from change that would have occurred without human interference. Linking cause and effect is especially difficult in Mountain regions where physical processes can operate at ferocious rates and ecosystems are sensitive to rapid degradation by climate change and resource development. In addition, highland inhabitants are more Vulnerable to natural hazards and political-economic marginalization than Populations elsewhere. This address focuses on the Nanga Parbat massif in the Himalaya Range of Pakistan, Garhwal Himalaya of northwest India, and Manaslu-Ganesh Himals of central Nepal. I have highlighted three special insights that geographers offer to increase understanding of human impacts on the stability of mountain landscapes. First, the mixed methods and theories we employ-quantitative and qualitative, postpositivist science and social theory, muddy-boots fieldwork linked with GIScience-together position geographers to resolve the debate over human-triggered changes in the physical landscape in mountains and explain the frequent disconnect between mountain science, policymaking, and resource management. Second, academic scholars and policymakers have come to realize that most problems require training, experience, and expertise in understanding physical and human systems. Third, modern techniques of measuring rates of geomorphic change help place the human factor in perspective and explain spatial variability of natural hazards. Forecasting environmental change remains elusive in \\the perfect landscape\\" of mountains."	10.1080/00045600802118491	WOS:000257910600001	2008	Land, life, and environmental change in mountains
403	Public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) increasingly are utilized in geographic research, yet researchers rarely are provided with guidance on how to implement PPGIS in an appropriate and effective manner. This article reports on the process of research that explores responses to current and future local tourism development offered by a sample of residents using a modified PPGIS approach called 'community action geographic information system'(CAGIS). The conceptual development of CAGIS is reported and the challenges encountered during its implementation in Churchill, Manitoba during 2005-2007 are reviewed. It is suggested that researchers wishing to conduct similar research should undertake thorough preliminary fieldwork to assess the likelihood of funding agreement on a common problem; acquiring adequate resources; establishing collective responsibility for the project's outcome; attaining stakeholder support; developing trust and meaningful relationships; and incorporating indigenous knowledge appropriately. Feedback of results to community members also should be an integral part of the research process. A number of feedback mechanisms ore reported, including an interactive weblog, which helped facilitate communication between heterogeneous groups in Churchill. Although ambitions for a truly participatory GIS approach to this project have been set aside, it is held that PPGIS con yield positive outcomes for communities and academia. Sharing this research experience will be useful to others who venture into PPGIS research, especially in northern communities.	10.1111/j.1541-0064.2008.00217.x	WOS:000260221300005	2008	Public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS)

405	This paper investigates the unique challenges of an expanding group of stakeholders making demands upon shared geospatial data resources: non governmental organisations participating in local governance. In spite of efforts to improve local data integration in spatial data infrastructures and development of strategies from public participation GIS to expand access to geospatial data and technologies, grassroots data users still experience difficulties with the accessibility, quality, and usefulness of local government data resources. Drawing from extended ethnographic research conducted in Chicago, Illinois, I illustrate these problems and how they are shaped by grassroots groups' resource constraints, knowledge systems, and socio-political positions; and assess the feasibility and impacts of proposed alternatives for better meeting grassroots spatial data needs. I contend that the needs and challenges of these stakeholders are unique from those of other users, but are nonetheless rooted in central dilemmas of spatial data handling, and so might be addressed through stronger engagement with GIScience research in this arena.	10.1080/13658810701348971	WOS:000253735500005	2008	Grassroots groups as stakeholders in spatial data infrastructures
406	We propose and systematically formalise a dynamical spatial systems approach for the modelling of changing spatial environments. The formalisation adheres to the semantics of the situation calculus and includes a systematic account of key aspects that are necessary to realize a domain-independent qualitative spatial theory that may be utilised across diverse application domains. The spatial theory is primarily derivable from the all-pervasive generic notion of \\qualitative spatial calculi\\" that are representative of differing aspects of space. In addition, the theory also includes aspects, both ontological and phenomenal in nature, that are considered inherent in dynamic spatial systems. Foundational to the formalisation is a causal theory that adheres to the representational and computational semantics of the situation calculus. This foundational theory provides the necessary (general) mechanism required to represent and reason about changing spatial environments and also includes an account of the key fundamental epistemological issues concerning the frame and the ramification problems that arise whilst modelling change within such domains. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that based on the structure and semantics of the proposed framework, fundamental reasoning tasks such as projection and explanation directly follow. Within the specialised spatial reasoning domain, these translate to spatial planning/re-configuration, causal explanation and spatial simulation. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that alternate formalisations of existing qualitative spatial calculi using high-level tools such as the situation calculus are essential for their utilisation in diverse application domains such as intelligent systems, cognitive robotics and event-based GIS."	10.1080/13875860801926884	WOS:000270113900006	2008	Modelling Dynamic Spatial Systems in the Situation Calculus
407	Traffic is a major source of air pollutants in urban environments, and exposure to these pollutants may be associated with adverse health effects. However, inconsistencies in observational epidemiological studies may be caused by differential measurement errors in various approaches in assessing exposure. We aimed to evaluate a simple method for assessing outdoor air pollutant concentrations in Oslo, Norway, through a land-use regression method. Samples of nitrogen oxides (NOx) were collected in two different weeks using Ogawa passive diffusion samplers simultaneously at 80 locations across Oslo. Independent variables used in subsequent regression models as predictors of the pollutants were derived using the Arc 9 geographic information system (GIS) software. indicators of land use, traffic, population density, and physical geography were tested. The final regression model yielded an adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.77 for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 0.66 for nitric oxide (NO), and 0.73 for NOx. The results suggest that a good predictive exposure model can be derived from this approach, which can be used to estimate long-term small-area variation in concentrations for individual exposure assessment in epidemiological studies in a highly cost-effective way. These small-area variations in traffic pollution are important since they may have associations with health effects. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

408	A Participatory Geographical Information System (PGIS) has been developed recently to design and adapt Geographic Information System (GIS) that draws on the diversity of experiences associated with \\participatory development\\" and involves communities in the production of GIS data and spatial decision-making tools. Participatory approach in the development of GIS helps to develop local knowledge processes. This knowledge process creates a channel of coordination between local people and the experts. The paper deals with the possibility of using spatial maps in consultation with local communities to develop an effective and sustainable distribution planning to maximize as well as ensure safe water coverage for the arsenic (As) exposed population in Mattab Upazila in southeastern Bangladesh. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) methods along with GIS were used to obtain relevant information from the field. Participants from different focus-groups were asked to determine their \\"own priorities\\" for spatial planning of alternative As-safe drinking water options. The study reveals that about 70% of the alternative safe water options were distributed after consultation with people. These distributed options were found to be superimposed within the existing safe water buffer zones which otherwise could have been avoided and thus increased the safe water coverage if the spatial maps were also consulted before selection of final installation sites. The study based on the community perspectives on demand-based safe water options thus reveals the suitability of using PGIS techniques for rational distribution of safe water options. The process of participatory mapping within focus-groups further makes a platform to enhance information about community needs of suitable safe water options in the study area."	10.1080/10934520701567221	WOS:000250556000025	2007	Use of GIS in local level participatory planning for arsenic mitigation
409	Recent years have witnessed a burgeoning of applications of GIS which grant legitimacy to indigenous geographical knowledge as well as to 'official' spatial data. By incorporating various forms of community participation these newer framings of Geographical Information Systems as 'Participatory GIS' (PGIS) offer a response to the critiques of GIS which were prevalent in the 1990s. This paper reviews PGIS in the context of the 'democratization of GIS'. It explores aspects of the control and ownership of geographical information, representations of local and indigenous knowledge, scale and scaling up, web-based approaches and some potential future technical and academic directions.	10.1177/0309132507081493	WOS:000250593300003	2007	Participatory GIS - a people's GIS?
410	The public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) research agenda has explored the issue of equitable access and use of geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial data among traditionally marginalized citizens, in order to facilitate effective citizen participation in inner-city revitalization activities. However, prior research indicates that PPGIS is a complex process, with uneven outcomes. The author contends that such unevenness can be explained by use of a new theoretical framework drawn from the literature of politics of scale and networks. The author contends that the PPGIS process occurs in 'spaces of dependence', containing localized social relations and place-specific conditions. The politics of securing this space leads to the creation of 'spaces of engagement' at multiple scales. Within these spaces, networks of association evolve to connect multiple actors from public and private sectors with community organizations. Such networks can contain structural inequities, hierarchical dominance, and fluctuating resources. But these networks also transcend political boundaries and are dynamic and flexible, enabling individuals to manipulate and modify them. In trying to control the revitalization agendas and the material resources required, the actors and community organizations construct politics of scale. For some community organizations, such scalar politics and creative alliances with critical actors allow them to navigate territorially scaled networks of power skillfully in order to gain an effective voice in decisionmaking activities. But other community organizations lag behind, and are not able to form relationships in order to secure their urban space. By the use of new empirical data, coupled with a new theoretical framework, the author aims to contribute both to greater theorization and to better understanding of the uneven and contradictory nature of PPGIS processes.	10.1068/a38247	WOS:000249086100012	2007	Politics of scale and networks of association in public participation GIS
411	In this paper, we introduce a family of expressive models for qualitative spatial reasoning with directions. The proposed family is based on the cognitive plausible cone-based model. We formally define the directional relations that can be expressed in each model of the family. Then, we use our formal framework to study two interesting problems: computing the inverse of a directional relation and composing two directional relations. For the composition operator, in particular, we concentrate on two commonly used definitions, namely, consistency-based and existential composition. Our formal framework allows us to prove that our solutions are correct. The presented solutions are handled in a uniform manner and apply to all of the models of the family.	10.1109/TKDE.2007.1046	WOS:000248223300009	2007	A family of directional relation models for extended objects
412	In many communities in northern Ghana, the environment has been altered by complex natural and human driven forces with significant impact on the lives of their inhabitants. The need to formulate an improved, holistic and consistent methodological approach to assess the problem is critical for sustainable natural resource management. This paper examines the potential of the DPSIR environmental assessment framework utilizing GIS-based participatory methodology in the assessment of environmental degradation in northern Ghana. Community truthing tools such as key informant interviews, focus group discussions, participant observation and participatory Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were employed as a means of soliciting societal responses integrated to conventional GIS spatial analysis to measure the indicators of the Driving force-Pressure-State-Impacts-Response (DPSIR) assessment framework. Post classification GIS imagery results show a marked natural vegetation decrease of 634 km2 (42%) of the study area with a corresponding increase of 600 km(2) (39%) of grasses and built-up and barren environment in the period of 14 years from 1990 to 2004. This is attributed to extreme climatic conditions and human driven causes such as poverty, population growth, migration and land tenure system. Poverty reduction strategies, amendment of the Mining and Mineral Law (PNDC law 153), improvement of the existing land tenure system and the control of migrants and Fulani herdsmen from neighbouring Burkina Faso were some of the solutions selected by the research participants, to be emphasized in the National Environmental Action Plan (EPA Act 490). This paper concludes that the DPSIR environmental assessment framework is an effective means of organizing complex environmental information to facilitate policy decision making.	10.1111/j.1477-8947.2007.00152.x	WOS:000249994000005	2007	Application of the DPSIR framework to environmental degradation assessment in northern Ghana
413	Purpose: We examined the geographic bias of four methods of geocoding addresses using ArcGIS, commercial firm, SAS/GIS, and aerial photography. We compared \\point- in-polygon\\" (ArcGIS, commercial firm, and aerial photography) and the \\"look-up table\\" method (SAS/GIS) to allocate addresses to census geography, particularly as it relates to census-based poverty rates. Methods: We randomly selected 299 addresses of children treated for asthma at an urban emergency department (1999-2001). The coordinates of the building address side door were obtained by constant offset based on ArcGIS and a commercial firm and true ground location based on aerial photography. Results: Coordinates were available for 261 addresses across all methods. For 24% to 30% of geocoded road/door coordinates the positional error was 51 meters or greater, which was similar across geocoding methods. The mean bearing was -26.8 degrees for the vector of coordinates based on aerial photography and ArcGIS and 8.5 degrees for the vector based on aerial photography and the commercial firm (p < 0.0001). ArcGIS and the commercial firm performed very well relative to SAS/GIS in terms of allocation to census geography. For 20%, the door location based on aerial photography was assigned to a different block group compared to SAS/GIS. The block group poverty rate varied at least two standard deviations for 6% to 7% of addresses. Conclusion: We found important differences in distance and bearing between geocoding relative to aerial photography. Allocation of locations based on aerial photography to census-based geographic areas could lead to substantial errors."	10.1016/j.annepidem.2006.10.015	WOS:000247257100010	2007	Positional accuracy and geographic bias of four methods of geocoding in epidemiologic research
414	This paper examines the relationships between place attachment and landscape values using two measures of place attachment-a psychometric, scale-based measure [Williams, D. R., & Vaske, J. J. (2003). The measurement of place attachment: Validity and generalisability of a psychometric approach. Forest Science, 49(6), 830-840] and a map-based measure derived from mapped special places [Brown, G. (2005). Mapping spatial attributes in survey research for natural resource management: Methods and applications. Society and Natural Resources, 18(l), 17-39]. We first examine the external validity of a two-dimensional, psychometric place attachment scale in Australia and its relationship with place-based landscape values. The place attachment scale and landscape value measures were included in a mail survey of residents and visitors to the Otways region (Victoria, Australia). Exploratory factor analysis of resident subgroups and visitors demonstrate the place attachment scale consists of two dimensions with high reliability. We use regression analysis to show that landscape importance values, especially spiritual and wilderness values, are significant predictors of the scale-based measure of place attachment. We then examine the relationship between a map-based measure of place attachment and landscape values. We use spatial cross-correlation and regression analyses to show that aesthetic, recreation, economic, spiritual, and therapeutic values spatially co-locate with special places and thus likely contribute to place attachment. We argue that survey mapping of landscape values and special places provides a reasonable proxy for scale-based measures of place attachment while providing richer, place-based information for land use planning. We conclude by introducing the concept of a map-based place attachment index and suggest that survey-based measures of landscape values and special places can be used to assess the risk associated with landscape modification. We provide a map showing one possible place attachment index for the Otways region and discuss its potential application. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

415	This article presents results of an empirical study about the use of a group-based geographic information system (GIS), called WaterGroup, developed as a collaborative spatial decision support system. WaterGroup was designed to enable stakeholder groups to participate in the solution of conjunctive water resource administration decision problems being addressed by the Idaho Department of Water Resources in the Boise River Basin of southwestern Idaho. The decision situation, software development, and empirical investigation are described within the context of other research activities/literatures related to group/community/public geographic information systems, helping us sort through the burgeoning terminology of this continually emerging field. We used Enhanced Adaptive Structuration Theory 2 to motivate research questions investigated by way of a field experiment research design. Decision process is characterized in terms of human-computer-human interaction coding. We used a technique called \\interaction coding\\" to compile three streams of data from videotapes as a record of interaction in two stakeholder-oriented decision workshops. Coded data are examined using nonparametric, exploratory sequential data analysis. Additionally, we used questionnaires to gather data regarding participant perceptions of WaterGroup and the decision process. The findings of this study indicate that different technology configurations foster a different balance between analytic and deliberative activities within phases of a conjunctive administration decision process. A low-technology, chauffeur-driven configuration in a phase encourages more deliberation, and a medium-technology, participant-driven configuration in a phase encourages more analysis. We discuss the findings and their implications for group-based GIS decision support. This article will be of interest to researchers involved in group-based GIS decision support software design, in empirical studies of stakeholder group-based decision support, and facilitators desiring to gain deeper insight into field settings involving group-based GIS decision support."	10.1111/j.1467-8306.2006.00512.x	WOS:000242221200002	2006	Collaborative water resource decision support
416	There have been several obstacles to an embrace of critical theoretical work in GIScience; chief among them is the barrier between conceptualization and formalization. Early critics of the technology were not cognizant that technological change must be implemented within the language of code. While critics expressed their concerns in a theoretical and esoteric language, increasingly GIScientists are at pains to address the same issues so that solutions can be incorporated into software technologies. Indeed an implicit recognition of the important divide between informal and formal environments has aided GIScience researchers in developing strategies to represent multiple epistemologies in GIS. The article begins with a review of early critical GIScience, examines the degree of its acceptance in the light of a content analysis of GIS journals, and then illustrates that the issue of multiple representation of the same reality is being addressed under the rubric of ontologies. New research in this area has had significant impact on GIScience because it has been articulated and addressed at both the conceptual and formal stages-a criterion for real changes to both GISystems and GIScience. The article concludes with an examination of why critical GIS remains relevant to the discipline, in spite of efforts to address issues of representation within GIScience.	10.1111/j.1467-8306.2006.00513.x	WOS:000242221200003	2006	Formalization matters

418	Our purpose in this paper is to conceptualize and demonstrate an integrated analytical method for using both qualitative and quantitative data through geographic information systems (GIS) and ethnography. We acknowledge that the use of both types of data has been possible in GIS for some time, particularly for representation purposes. However, a recursive integration of different forms of data at the analysis level has been less explored and minimally theorized. Drawing on recent work in critical GIS and feminist perspectives, we suggest that visualization offers a strong technique for this effort but we approach it from the analytical base of grounded theory. Thus, we present an example of how grounded theory and visualization might be used together to construct an integrated analysis strategy that is both iterative and reflexive, both contextual and conceptual. We use Knigge's work on community gardens in Buffalo, New York, to provide a substantive example of the proposed methods.	10.1068/a37327	WOS:000242634900005	2006	Grounded visualization
419	In this paper I report on a participatory planning project undertaken in a community engaged in a ten-year revitalization effort. Working with several youth-serving organizations, a community planning project was conducted in which local youth collected qualitative data about their neighborhood through a variety of techniques (photography, drawings, narratives). The project took place against the backdrop of an emerging neighborhood indicators geographical information system (GIS) aimed at tracking the impact of the revitalization effort. Although techniques for collecting and using qualitative data have matured during several decades of use in the field of participatory planning and development, their effective incorporation into GIS remains elusive. Although few technical barriers remain, the absence of stakeholder participation and the lack of community capacity to implement a community-based GIS are important obstacles to a fully realized qualitative GIS. Drawing on the youth-development literature, I demonstrate in this case study the potential of qualitative GIS for engaging young people in participatory planning, while also highlighting the continuing challenge to its implementation.	10.1068/a3861	WOS:000242634900006	2006	Prospects for qualitative GIS at the intersection of youth development and participatory urban planning
420	We discuss locations as defined by their qualitative spatial relations to other features, dubbed qualitative locations (QL). We further propose a mechanism to handle queries with qualitative locations in geospatial information systems. For the realization of the mechanism for QL-based queries, we propose a conceptual framework that takes advantage of models of qualitative spatial reasoning to bridge the gap between conventional metric spatial information systems and the general public's common-sense query of spatial relations in natural language.

421	The roles, relationships, and strategies of state and civil society institutions in urban planning, problem solving, and service delivery are in flux. In trying to understand how these changes affect community organizations, grassroots groups, and local-level institutions of civil society, existing research has tended to conceptualize these roles through a series of oppositional dialectics, such as cooptation or resistance. This article shows instead that community organizations shift their technological, institutional, and spatial approaches to urban planning and problem solving in creative and multifaceted ways. They produce a variety of spatial narratives to advance their agendas by strategically enacting multiple roles vis-a-vis a diverse set of actors and institutions. Information technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) can play a central role in this approach. Community organizations apply their own interpretive frameworks to GIS-based maps and images to produce spatial narratives of local needs, conditions, and assets that may be adapted to the diverse roles and relationships they negotiate in urban spatial politics. These arguments are developed from ethnographic research carried out with two inner-city Chicago community organizations pursuing a range of neighborhood improvement activities.	10.1111/j.1467-8306.2006.00480.x	WOS:000237871300005	2006	Beyond cooptation or resistance
422	The description models for spatial relations, especially those for direction relations, have gained increasing attention in GIS and Cartography community in recent decades. In this paper, such a quantitative model for spatial direction relations is discussed. It has been suggested that people often describe directions between two objects using multiple directions but not a single one; therefore a description model for direction relations should use multiple directions, i.e. direction group. A direction group consists of two components: the azimuths of the normals of direction Voronoi edges between two objects and the corresponding weights of the azimuths. The former can be calculated by means of Delaunay triangulation of the vertices and the points of intersection of the two objects; the latter can be calculated using the common areas of the two objects or the lengths of their direction Voronoi diagram (DVD) edges.The advantages of this model exist in four aspects: (1) direction computations are converted into a 1-dimension space problem and use lines (DVDs) to solve it, therefore direction computation process is simplified; (2) once Dir(A,B), the directions from A to B, is obtained, Dir(B,A) can be got without complex computations; (3) A quantitative direction group can be transformed into a qualitative one easily; (4) quantitative direction relations between objects can be recorded in 2-dimension tables, which is very useful in spatial reasoning.	10.1007/s10707-006-7578-1	WOS:000237339900003	2006	A quantitative description model for direction relations based on direction groups
424	The RCC8 constraint language developed by Randell et al. has been popularly adopted by the Qualitative Spatial Reasoning and GIS communities. The recent observation that RCC8 composition table describes only weak composition instead of composition raises questions about Renz and Nebel's maximality results about the computational complexity of reasoning with RCC8. This paper shows that any consistent RCC8 binary constraint network (RCC8 network for short) can be consistently extended. Given Theta, an RCC8 network, and z, a fresh variable, suppose xTy is an element of Theta and T is contained in the weak composition of R and S. This means that we can add two new constraints xRz and zSy to Theta without changing the consistency of the network. The result guarantees the applicability to RCC8 of one key technique, (Theorem 5) of [J. Renz, B. Nebel, On the complexity of qualitative spatial reasoning: A maximal tractable fragment of the Region Connection Calculus. Artificial Intelligence 108 (1999) 69-123], which allows the transfer of tractability of a set of RCC8 relations to its closure under composition, intersection, and converse. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

425	This study examines altitudinal residential segregation by race in 146 cities in the U.S. South. It begins by embedding the topic in recent theorizations of the social construction of nature, the geography of race, and environmental justice. Second, it focuses on how housing markets, particularly in the South, tend to segregate minorities in low-lying, flood-prone, and amenity-poor segments of urban areas. It tests empirically the hypothesis that blacks are disproportionately concentrated in lower-altitude areas using GIs to correlate race and elevation by digital elevation-model block group within each city in 1990 and 2000. The statistical results confirm the suspected trend. A map of coefficients indicates strong positive associations in cities in the interior South-where the hypothesis is confirmed-and an inverse relationship near the coast, where whites dominate higher-valued coastal properties. Selected city case studies demonstrate these relationships connecting the broad dynamics of racial segregation to the particularities of individual places.

426	Although there is some research on lesbian sexuality and space I contend that such analyses do not account for the ways in which lesbian parent families' actions and subjectivities are structured through the time-space nexus. The particularities of mothers' management of their maternal-sexual identities remain uncharted. In this article I interrogate how lesbian parent families negotiate everyday places, such as the street and schools and how they inhabit and produce space. I address their dis-location within academic studies, situating the home as critical in lesbian parents' consolidation of self. Home represents one of the few places where the sexual and maternal identities of lesbian parents may be reconciled. I suggest that the multiple identifications and subject positions of lesbian mothers and their families need to be acknowledged so that they may be included within the queer cartography of lesbian and gay space. The data cited in this article come from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 18 lesbian mothers and 13 of their children, who live across the Yorkshire region in the United Kingdom.	10.1080/09663690500356768	WOS:000233844900003	2005	Locating lesbian parent families
427	This paper critically reviews and analyses participatory GIS (PGIS) and participatory mapping applications within participatory spatial planning for community-based natural resource management in developing countries. There is an often implicit assumption that PGIS use is effective, in that it meets content needs, satisfies underlying local stakeholder interests and therefore is a tool for better governance. The analytical framework looks at participatory spatial planning performance with respect to key dimensions of governance, especially the intensity of community participation and empowerment, equity within communities and between 'governed' and 'governing', respect for indigenous knowledge, rights, ownership, legitimacy, and effectiveness. Specific development focus is given by a case study using participatory mapping and PGIS in community forest legitimization, planning and management in Tinto, Cameroon. 'Good governance' criteria are applied ex-post to the implementation procedures, the geoinformation outputs, and the longer-term outcomes of the PGIS processes. impacts of incorporating PGIS were examined in terms of the types and degrees of participation in the process; access to, and the uses made of, the geographic information; whether the information outputs met stakeholders' requirements; and the overall changes in equity and empowerment in the community. It was found that PGIS/participatory mapping processes contributed - positively, though not comprehensively - to good governance, by improving dialogue, redistributing resource access and control rights - though not always equitably - legitimizing and Using local knowledge, exposing local stakeholders to geospatial analysis, and creating some actor empowerment through training. PGIS promoted empowerment by supporting community members' participation in decision-making and actions, and by enabling land use planning decisions beyond community forestry itself.	10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00173.x	WOS:000234166200004	2005	Assessing participatory GIS for community-based natural resource management
428	Qualitative spatial reasoning forms an important part of the commonsense reasoning required for building intelligent Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Previous research has come up with models to capture cardinal direction relations for typical GIS data. In this paper, we target the problem of efficiently computing the cardinal direction relations between regions that are composed of sets of polygons and present two algorithms for this task. The first of the proposed algorithms is purely qualitative and computes, in linear time, the cardinal direction relations between the input regions. The second has a quantitative aspect and computes, also in linear time, the cardinal direction relations with percentages between the input regions. Our experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed algorithms outperform existing methodologies. The algorithms have been implemented and embedded in an actual system, CARDIRECT, that allows the user to 1) specify and annotate regions of interest in an image or a map, 2) compute cardinal direction relations between them, and 3) pose queries in order to retrieve combinations of interesting regions.	10.1109/TKDE.2005.192	WOS:000232664700002	2005	Computing and managing cardinal direction relations
429	It has long been recognized that information technology (IT) can facilitate (or even permit) forms of empirical analysis unimagined just a generation ago. However, political scientists have generally experimented with only a narrow range of the possibilities the new technologies offer - easier writing, editing and communications processes, and more sophisticated statistical analyses. While these have undoubtedly increased productivity and rigor within the discipline, other IT applications have largely gone unnoticed. The growing pool of Computer-Aided Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) technologies presents researchers with new ways to conceptualize, perceive, and communicate their research, with the potential of revolutionizing social science research. This paper offers an overview of those IT and CAQDAS solutions with the most potential to facilitate political inquiry, and offers a series of practical steps by which technological novices might begin to apply the new technologies in their research. In closing, we discuss the benefits and perils of using such technology, and suggest the ways by which IT might strengthen current research techniques.

431	This article examines survival strategies of urban households in post-socialist cities during the transition from the Soviet system to a market economy. The article links the outcomes of systemic transformation to the daily lives of households and connects urban change induced by mass privatization to class and gender processes inside the households. These \\other transitions\\" in everyday class and gender processes are consistently overlooked by macroeconomic approaches that dominate among transition theorists and policy consultants. The focus is on households in a Moscow neighborhood who attempt to meet the competing demands of earning income, fulfilling domestic responsibilities, and securing child care in a rapidly changing urban context. The diverse formal and informal economic practices of households are analyzed using the model of \\"multiple economies\\" that include paid work, informal work for cash, unpaid domestic labor, and help in kind, labor, and cash from networks of extended family, friends, and neighbors. Mapping the typically invisible transformations of multiple economies of households contributes to creating alternative geographies of transition that are rooted in daily household experiences, acknowledges the existence of multiple economies practices, and emphasizes their importance for household social reproduction. The research combined qualitative interviewing with GIS (geographic information systems) in order to develop the model of multiple economies, elicit household perspectives on urban change, and provide the information for mapping of the landscape of multiple economies. GIS was also used to understand the dynamics of local urban change resulting from privatization."	10.1111/j.1467-8306.2004.09402011.x	WOS:000221906300011	2004	Other transitions
432	A distinguishing feature of conservation planning and analysis methods is that they generally rely on biological assessments carried out using scientific sampling protocols and methodologies. Few conservation planning methods explicitly include what is variably described as values, understanding and perceptions. In this study, we examine the potential use of local values of biological resources in conservation planning by comparing this with scientific biological assessment of the same region, using the example of Prince William Sound, Alaska (USA). Specifically, we compare the spatial coincidence of local perceptions of biological importance (or value) identified in a survey of Alaska residents with biologically significant areas identified by scientists familiar with the area from a marine conservation workshop. The results indicate a moderate degree of spatial coincidence between local values and scientific assessment with obvious geographic areas of agreement and disagreement. We suggest that incorporation of local perceptions of biological importance can complement and strengthen scientific biological assessments and propose an iterative conservation planning process that includes both methodologies.

433	This article reviews the discourse about geographic information system's (GIS) potential as a tool for intervening in disputes over access to natural resources. GIS is a planning tool with striking analytical capabilities and a great public appeal that can be utilized for explicitly reasoned discussions to facilitate conflict resolution. However, the technology's reputation as an interventionist tool has been undermined by competing claims about human factors that sustain conflicts. Some scholars believe elements of a conflict are manageable and that meaningful communication between disputants will erase misconceptions and generate consensus. Others reject cooperation and instead emphasize self-interest and competition as the driving forces behind conflicts. This article investigates the two claims and argues that both the competitive push to claim independent rewards and the urge to create joint values are present in a conflict resolution. A more productive discussion of GIS's role in conflict management, therefore, involves unpacking the links between competitive forces that sustain a conflict and the social norms and group expectations that govern human behavior in society. The article discusses the links between value systems, opinions, and actions and how a GIS application might influence such human attributes to induce changes that promote cooperation. The study concludes with a case study involving the use of GIS to manage a conflict over natural resources allocation in a rural community in Southern Ghana.	10.1111/j.1467-8306.2004.09401003.x	WOS:000189291300003	2004	Of intractable conflicts and participatory GIS applications
434	The quickly increasing number of spatio-temporal applications in fields like environmental monitoring, geology and mobile communication is a new challenge to the development of geodatabases. However, the query functionality of today's geo-information systems is still limited to the thematic attributes of spatial objects and to spatial 2-D objects. This article reports on GeoToolKit, an object-oriented geo-database kernel system developed at Bonn University to support 3-D/4-D geological applications. GeoToolKit is not a GIS-in-a-box package, but rather a library of C + + classes that allows the incorporation of spatio-temporal functionality within an application. Being a component toolkit, it encourages the development and deployment of re-usable and open software. The history, concepts and implementation of GeoToolKit are discussed in detail. Performance tests underline the practicability of the concepts. Extensions to and experiences with GeoToolKit applications like GeoStore, GeoWeb and WellStore are presented. Finally, we give an outlook on our future research introducing GeoToolKit as a 3-D/4-D database component within a network of distributed and mobile geo-information services.	10.1023/B:GEIN.0000007723.77851.8f	WOS:000187179400001	2004	The story of the GeoToolKit - An object-oriented geodatabase kernel system
435	This article investigates the cognitive processes used by learners (adults and young adolescents) for tasks that require the integration of geographical information across spaces, hierarchies, and geographic scales. An experiment simulated basic GIS functions and contained four experimental conditions (Chunk, Layer, Scale, and Whole). Reaction time, accuracy, and confidence were recorded as dependent variables related to the success of the integration process. The data were used as input for a back-propagation neural-network model. The neural network model was successful in learning patterns and could be used to predict the confidence, reaction time, and accuracy for combinations of learners, experimental conditions, and map-feature categories. A multivariate analysis of variance was used to determine significant relationships among the behavioral variables and characteristics of the learners, experimental conditions related to GIS functions, and map features (points, lines, and areas). The results of the analysis generally indicated that young adolescent learners were slower, less accurate, and more confident than adult learners for all experimental conditions. Overall, subjects were more accurate and confident in tasks that required less integration of geographical information. Learners had the most success recalling information related to area symbols and the least success recalling information related to point symbols.	10.1111/j.1467-8306.2003.09304004.x	WOS:000186795900004	2003	Technology and map-learning
436	The adoption of participatory spatial planning (PSP) approaches has been partially supported by developments in participatory-GIS (P-GIS), as seen in applications both in local resource management in developing South countries, and in community neighbourhood planning in the urban North. Such applications provide a basis for examining the relationship between the use of geo-information and governance, as many P-GIS initiatives claim to foster accountability, transparency, legitimacy and other dimensions of governance. Examples from recent literature illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of utilising P-GIS, and in particular, the implications for greater participation, empowerment, and ownership of and access to spatial information, and for governance in general. Some new developments in GIS technology, like 'mobile-GIS', have the potential to strengthen these impacts. While P-GIS is not an essential component of PSP, if used with an adequate regard and sensitivity for issues of ownership, legitimacy and local knowledge, it can contribute to the empowerment of communities in solving spatial planning problems.

437	Our investigation of the geography of fall injuries considers the relationship between injury prevention and contextual approaches to health research. We use a geographic information system (GIS) to describe the pattern of emergency department reported falls of the elderly in the Capital Health Region, an administrative health area in Alberta, Canada. We used empirical Bayes estimates to obtain a geographic measure of fall incidence over the study area and a cluster detection statistic to measure the presence of a significant spatial cluster in the region. Inner-city Edmonton had the highest incidence of risk, suburban Edmonton the lowest, and surrounding rural regions and smaller communities had more moderate fall incidence. We argue that descriptive geography can enhance the effectiveness of injury prevention programs by identifying zones of high risk, even when the individual-level and contextual factors that explain the underlying patterns are unknown.

438	Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are often seen as incompatible with participatory processes. However, since the late 1990s, attempts have been made in numerous  and are investments too great for remote rural areas? Examples of successful use of GIS are provided in this article, while practical complications and methodological constraints are highlighted." projects around the world to define \\best practices\\" for improved natural resource management projects that integrate participation and accurate spatial information, using GIS (for example, see www.iapad.org/participatory_gis.htm). This article describes a project in the Peruvian Andes where spatial information played a key role. Can GIS help narrow the gap between professionals and farmers or local officials? Or is it really a top-down tool that requires too much expert knowledge	10.1659/0276-4741(2003)023[0320:GAATIP]2.0.CO;2	WOS:000187317300003	2003	GIS as a tool in participatory natural resource management - Examples from the Peruvian Andes
439	Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) is a field of research that, among other things, focuses on the use of GIS by non-experts and occasional users. These users tend to have a diverse range of computer literacy, world views, cultural backgrounds and knowledge. These aspects require that the systems used within PPGIS are accessible and easy to use. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the related usability evaluation techniques focus on how to make computer systems more accessible, while focusing on user needs and requirements. Thus, the synergy between PPGIS and HCI seems natural. In this paper, we discuss the aspects of this synergy, building on our experience from three workshops. We demonstrate how usability evaluation can contribute to PPGIS research, and how PPGIS research can contribute to the HCI aspects of GIS in general. We conclude this paper with a call for a user-centred design approach to PPGIS projects.	10.1080/1365881031000114107	WOS:000185178000004	2003	Usability evaluation and PPGIS
440	Objective To determine the relationship between blood lead concentration (Pb-S), and sociodemographic parameters among children. Methods Blood lead concentration (Pb-S) was determined in 243 children (aged 5.94 +/- 2.78 years) in the district of Valencia. The required analysis was performed at the Center for Toxicological Investigations of University of Carabobo (CITUC), Venezuela, between January 1st, 1998 to December 31st, 2000. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology was used for data mapping. Results Average Pb-S (11.62 ug/dl) was significantly higher than the allowed levels. One hundred and fifty (61.7%) children had Pb-S levels above the allowed concentration (VSLP) and this amount was significantly high in relation to the total number of subjects studied. The logistic regression analysis showed a significant association of sectors 12 (status A) and 16 and 28 (status C) with VSLP (R=0.1189; p less than or equal to 0,01; R=0.1202, pless than or equal to0,01 and R=0.1189; pless than or equal to0.01, respectively). Odds ratio showed that children from status C are 7,286 times more likely to have Pb-S VSLP than those from A or B. Conclusions This study confirms that SGI and epidemiological-statistical methods widen the possibilities of preventing contaminants' adverse health effects. It also shows that correlating geographical and health data has allowed to identifying \\high risk\\" areas, leading to a pro-active public health action."	10.1590/S0034-89102003000400016	WOS:000185420300015	2003	Association between blood lead and sociodemographic parameters among children
441	As a result of increasingly apparent and problematic effects of global information system and remote sensing technologies, there has been increased emphasis on demonstrating and incorporating indigenous environmental knowledges in land use and cover analysis. Such approaches, though ethnographically revealing and politically efficacious, tend to reproduce a model of difference between local and scientific knowledges that is epistemologically untenable. This paper demonstrates an alternative use of geographic information system and remotely sensed imagery to both demonstrate the partiality of mapping technology and show possibilities for critical usage of the tool. Using a case from India, the research shows a method to elicit and explore competing environmental knowledges, including and especially those of \\scientific\\" experts. The analysis concludes that, for both local producers and expert managers, the cultural meaning of landscapes is dependent on their roles in regional production and resource politics."	10.1023/A:1023932829887	WOS:000183205700004	2003	Beyond ground truth
442	Environmental analysts increasingly utilize remote sensing (RS) and geographic information science (GIS) techniques to study the relationship between human societies and their biophysical environment. This paper considers the influence these techniques have had on environmental research. Using the case of the Sahel, the paper first relates contemporary applications of RS/GIS to the history of the environmental scientific practice in the region. While facilitating an expansion of spatiotemporal scales, applications of these new techniques continue the methodological failings of the past by relying on visual measures of environmental change and problematic indicators of human land-use pressures. The human ecology fields ( human, cultural, and political ecologies), by emphasizing the causal connections between local management and environmental change, can address the problems inherent with the spatial analytical turn in environmental science. Using the author's experience with the use of GIS in a political ecology study of grazing management in western Niger, ways of more closely integrating RS/GIS techniques into human ecological research are discussed.	10.1023/A:1023984813957	WOS:000183205700005	2003	Methodological reflections on the use of remote sensing and geographic information science in human ecological research
443	This article examines the process by which remotely sensed land cover maps work to both simplify and complicate landscapes. The central argument is not merely that the construction of land cover maps is complex, but that the points of complexity often arise through the process of trying to simplify. In other words, the forces of complexity are intimately connected to the forces of simplicity and vice versa. This article takes as a case study the production of WISCLAND, ( Wisconsin Initiative for Statewide Cooperation on Landscape Analysis and Data), a statewide land cover map of Wisconsin derived from remote sensing data and GIS ( Geographic Information Systems) technologies and proceeds by analysis of mapping methodology, practice, and representation. In addition to the development of a more nuanced critique of the use of land cover maps, it facilitates the possibility for a constructive dialogue between remote sensing practitioners and the critical GIS community.	10.1023/A:1023936930795	WOS:000183205700006	2003	Mapping tension
444	Geographic information systems (GIS) technology is increasingly being used by nongovernmental organizations, grassroots organizations and other activist groups involved in transforming social, economic and environmental policy in multiple countries. The use of GIS represents a response to the fact that environmental problems are multidimensional and refuse to acknowledge political borders. It also represents a growing awareness that, for activism to compete in an era of globalization, it must utilize tools that scale from a local to a multinational level. A research field called public participation GIS (PPGIS) has emerged to investigate the use and value of GIS by marginalized peoples and communities engaged in social change. It has yet to formally examine cross-border and multinational applications. This paper makes a substantial contribution to moving the PPGIS research agenda forward to pace existing nonprofit activities. The paper considers the critical aspects of PPGIS being used across borders and in scaling up nonprofit organizations. The paper briefly reviews the PPGIS literature on issues of resources and data access and the role of GIS expertise. It then analyzes the use of PPGIS across borders as a function of building organizational capacity. Theory is reinforced with examples of nonprofits currently using GIS in multiple countries. A transnational PPGIS is framed, which can serve as a base for further investigation and discussion.	10.1111/1541-0064.02e12	WOS:000183475200006	2003	Public participation geographic information systems across borders
445	The authors examine the relevance of public participation geographic information systems (PPGISs) to housing-estate management in Singapore. Formal interviews were conducted with five key informants to collect data. A mock-up PPGIS was developed and evaluated. Informal interviews with property managers and secondary data also contributed to the discussions. Findings suggest that the current level of information technology applications and the mandate to build a 'People's Town' in Singapore's public housing estate have laid a solid base for introducing PPGIS to housing-estate management. The existing channels of public participation in town council management also pointed to a collective form, based on the Residents' Committees, for accessing and using the PPGIS. It is hoped that this study contributes to PPGIS research by extending explorations to a new cultural context and to a new application area.	10.1068/b12938	WOS:000181319800007	2003	Public participation GIS (PPGIS) for town council management in Singapore
446	Despite considerable progress in recent geographic information systems (GIS) research (especially on public-participation GIS), the critical discourse on GIS in the 1990s does not seem to have affected GIS practices in geographic research in significant ways. Development in critical GIS practice has been quite limited to date, and GIS and critical geographies remain two separate, if not overtly antagonistic, worlds. This suggests that critical engagement that seeks to conceive and materialize the critical potential of GIS for geographic research is still sorely needed. In this article, I explore the possibilities for this kind of critical engagement through revisiting some of the central arguments in the critical discourse from feminist perspectives. I examine whether GIS methods are inherently incompatible with feminist epistemologies through interrogating their connection with positivist scientific practices and visualization technologies. Bearing in mind the limitations of current GIS, I explore several ways in which GIS methods may be used to enrich feminist geographic research. I propose to reimagine GIS as a method in feminist geography and describe feminist visualization as a possible critical practice in feminist research. I argue that GIS can be re-envisioned and used in feminist geography in ways that are congenial to feminist epistemologies and politics. These alternative practices represent a new kind of critical engagement with GIS that is grounded on the critical agency of the GIS user/researcher.	10.1111/1467-8306.00309	WOS:000180051200003	2002	Feminist visualization
447	This paper deals with the representation and the processing of information about spatial objects with indeterminate location like valleys or dunes (objects subject to vagueness). The indeterminacy of the location of spatial objects is caused by the vagueness of the unity condition provided by the underlying human concepts valley and dune. We propose the notion of rough, i.e., approximate, location for representing and processing information about indeterminate location of objects subject to vagueness. We provide an analysis of the relationships between vagueness of concepts, indeterminacy of location of objects, and rough approximations using methods of formal ontology. In the second part of the paper we propose an algebraic formalization of rough location, and hence, a formal method for the representation of objects subject to vagueness on a computer. We further define operations on those representations, which can be interpreted as union and intersection operations between those objects. The discussion of vagueness of concepts, indeterminacy of location, rough location and the relationships between these notions contributes to the theory about the ontology of geographic space. The formalization presented can provide the foundation for the implementation of vague objects and their location indeterminacy in GIS.	10.1023/A:1015291525685	WOS:000175136300001	2002	Vagueness and rough location
448	Geographic information systems (GIS) technology offers a new way for different disciplines to jointly learn and manage our planet's resources. However, GIS data sources and processes preclude participation of non-technology experts who may have crucial environmental information to share. This paper is about a study in using participatory methods in what usually is an expert-dependent use of GIS. It hinges on the technology's integrative spatial analysis capability and people's intimate knowledge of their own space. The case study details how isolated rural farmers of Ifugao, Northern Philippines engaged in collectively interpreting aerial-photographs and satellite images, and tracing their successful tradition in terraced agriculture. In the process, a different side of GIS is shown-from mapping and data management to that of jointly constructing and understanding the 'world' to be managed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

449	Studies about geographical information systems (GIS) use contribute to geographic information science through critical evaluation of the concepts embedded in GIS tools. Social-behavioural studies about group use of GIS help us to understand the social implications of GIS because groups are fundamental units underlying intra-organizational, organization-wide, and inter-organizational activity in society. When group communication technology is integrated with basic GIS capabilities an enhanced version of GIS called 'participatory GIS' (PGIS) is created. Group use of PGIS technology can be studied by sampling social-behavioural events during human-computer-human interaction. Social-behavioural research about PGIS use requires an informed balance among three research domains-substantive, theoretical, and methodological-if we are to make balanced progress in participatory geographical information science associated with the critical evaluation of GIS use. In this paper, we draw from our research on GIS-supported collaborative decision making about land use and resource planning and a conceptual framework called Enhanced Adaptive Structuration Theory. We develop a new framework for understanding choices among data-gathering strategies for social-behavioural studies about PGIS use. The framework for data-gathering strategies is composed of two dimensions. One dimension is the level of induced control in social-behavioural relations during GIS use in a research setting. The other is the amount of pre- or post-structuring of variables embedded in data-collection techniques. Several common data-gathering strategies, e. g. laboratory experiment, field experiment, case study, and field survey, are differentiated in terms of those dimensions. Objectives for empirical research are used to compare and contrast the data-gathering strategies. This framework helps researchers understand the trade-offs among various data-gathering strategies as the core of research designs for critical evaluations of PGIS use.	10.1080/13658810110075987	WOS:000173250000001	2002	Data-gathering strategies for social-behavioural research about participatory geographical information system use
450	In this paper we describe an attempt to create an inclusive and participatory information sharing network across a large geographic region, the Gulf of Maine. This network aims to contribute to the health of the region's human and natural environments through facilitating partnerships among individuals and organizations that are already working toward this goal. Initiated at a time when cooperation, public learning, and information sharing increasingly depend on digital information technologies, this effort represents a turn away from earlier attempts to create centralized data sharing systems toward a more people-centered and project-centered approach. After introducing the Gulf of Maine Environmental Information Exchange and its region, particular projects will be described, along with the on-line technologies that are being applied including those related to digital mapping. A description of the purposes of the Information Exchange follows, with details about a network organization which is being shaped based on principles that have emerged through participant interactions. Public participation GIS and the community-based fisheries management movement are presented as examples of participatory governance that have contributed to discussions within the Information Exchange. We conclude with a summary of the accomplishments of this network building process and the challenges its participants recognize at this time.	10.1068/b2749t	WOS:000172859600005	2001	The Gulf of Maine Environmental Information Exchange
451	In this paper we describe the development of Internet-based approaches to public participation and on-line spatial decision support systems in particular. Two case studies in developing web-based public participation GIS (PPGIS), one local and one regional, are described in detail. Results from the live testing of these systems are shown. These are discussed in the light of recent developments in 'cyberdemocracy' and conclusions are drawn about principles of on-line PPGIS and problems associated with public participation, user interaction, and familiarity with IT, copyright issues, access to the Internet, and relevant political structures.	10.1068/b2751t	WOS:000172859600007	2001	Public participation, GIS, and cyberdemocracy
452	Development planning in South Africa is moving towards a people-centred, democratic approach with a strong emphasis on community involvement, which had previously been lacking. This paradigmatic shift to an integrated and considerate approach lends itself to the inclusion of spatially orientated geographical information systems (GIS) technology. The paper outlines a number of South African planning processes and shows how GIS could be incorporated to the betterment of these processes. Cognisance is taken of a number of concerns surrounding the utilisation of what is traditionally perceived to be a top-down, authoritative, technocratic technology. A number of solutions are proposed, including the development of a participatory GIS and the co-construction of decision-making processes through community communication. A key issue to consider is the need for the planning process to develop a 'conscience' and become 'considerate', in order to facilitate the development and implementation of a successful process and to communicate these findings to previously disempowered communities.

453	Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are increasingly applied as modern tools for analysis and visualization of health-related spatial data, especially in epidemiological research. GIS are used by medical researchers and executives in the public health service. A community-based survey was conducted according to the phase II protocol of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) in Munich. The spatial patterns of disease incidence were analysed and related to exposure data by GIS. The prevalence study on fourth-grade pupils (n=3354) and school beginners (n = 2890) was conducted during the school term 1995/96 in Munich. Parental questionnaires and measurements of lung function and immunological parameters were used. The questionnaire data were integrated in a GIS database. In this paper we discuss methodological aspects of GIS-based spatial analysis related to epidemiological data. In addition, we investigate whether there were spatial clusters of children with wheeze in the last 12 months of a magnitude unlikely to occur by chance and which could indicate local health risks. The study was based on permutation tests where global and local methods were applied. No spatial clusters of children with asthma symptoms were identified in the city of Munich.	10.1055/s-2000-12608	WOS:000089270900001	2000	Application of geographical information systems (GIS) in epidemiological studies using the example of the ISAAC study Munich
454	The African continent is portrayed in development texts as experiencing environmental crises of staggering proportions. Despite a lack of reliable data, the World Bank considers environmental degradation to be so widespread that the \\business\\" of environmental planning and regulation is now seen as a global affair. It currently requires low-income countries receiving its financial assistance to develop National Environmental Action Plans (NEAPs) which, in assembly line fashion, are bring produced according to a blueprint. Taking the West African case study of Cote d'Ivoire, this paper argues that the planning process, specifically the identification of environmental problems, is based on a poor understanding of the nature and direction of environmental change. We confront this data problem by contrasting the image of a deforested savanna landscape found in the Cote d'Ivoire NEAP with the more wooded landscape experienced by farmers and herders and confirmed by our analysis of aerial photographs. Our second objective is to address thr policy implications of two geographical issues rising from this paper: the disjointed scale problem between local/regional environmental-change patterns and global environmental discourses, and the human-environmental consequences of ignoring actual versus imagined environmental problems. A third goal is to contribute to the growing convergence in cultural and political ecology around the use of multiple research methods to explain environmental-change dynamics. Our discussion of environmental change is informed by intensive data collection in two rural communities in the Korhogo region of northern Cote d'Ivoire. Research methods included focus-group discussions and household surveys to record local perceptions of environmental change. Aerial photo analysis, GIS mapping, and vegetation transects were used to interpret land-cover changes. Finally, interviews with individuals involved in the NEAP process in the Cote d'Ivoire government, World Bank, and NGOs illuminated the received ideas and institutional interests of various players in environmental planning."	10.1111/0004-5608.00184	WOS:000085616200004	2000	Environmental discourses and the Ivorian Savanna
455	As in other areas of planning practice, the use of GIS in neighborhood planning has assumed a technical: top-down approach. Given the fact that GIS are essentially about providing and analyzing spatial data, it is difficult to envision how their use in local communities could be construed otherwise. In this paper I make a case for the need to channel intellectual energy,into developing an approach and methodology for resident-generated GIS. Specifically I argue-that there is:a need to exploit GIS in the investigation of residents' perceptions of local neighborhood environments. I explore this approach in five sections. First, I present a definition of resident-generated GIS and position it within the larger debate on public participation GIS. Second, I offer a review of the current use of GIS in local neighborhood communities. This consists of an empirical assessment of neighborhood GIS as well as a critique of community GIS from the perspective of scholars in planning and geography. Third, I review the theoretical background that is integral to-and must form the basis of-a resident-generated GIS. Three theoretical traditions are relevant: environmental perception; indigenous information and its use in GIS; and neighborhood-level issues that could be enlightened through the use of GIS. Fourth, I propose a methodological framework for constructing and utilizing resident-generated GIS. Fifth, I discuss the political implications of a resident-generated GIS.	10.1068/b260533	WOS:000082399600005	1999	Constructing neighborhoods from the bottom up
456	This article presents the description logic ALCRP(D) with concrete domains and a role-forming predicate operator as its prominent aspects. We demonstrate the feasibility of ALCRP(D) for reasoning about spatial objects and their qualitative spatial relationships and provide an appropriate concrete domain for spatial objects. The general significance of ALCRP(D) is demonstrated by adding temporal reasoning to spatial and terminological reasoning using a combined concrete domain. The theory is motivated as a basis for knowledge representation and query processing in the domain of geographic information systems. In contrast to existing work in this domain, which mainly focuses either on conceptual reasoning or on reasoning about qualitative spatial relations, we integrate reasoning about spatial information with terminological reasoning.	10.1093/logcom/9.3.351	WOS:000081607000005	1999	A description logic with concrete domains and a role-forming predicate operator
457	Logics for qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR) are presented and investigated. Some basic desiderata are suggested for such theories of QSR, relating to the underexplored issue of their formal semantics. We survey our earlier results in the field of QSR which show that existing theories fail to meet these desiderata. Finally, a complete calculus is presented, describing mereotopological relations between polygonal regions of the plane. The polygonal ontology supported by this logic is 'practical' in the sense that it is that employed by many computer systems for spatial representation, for example, in geographical information systems (GIS). We show that the proposed theory meets the desiderata outlined at the beginning of the paper. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.	10.1006/jvlc.1997.0068	WOS:000073047300002	1998	Complete logics for QSR
458	A framework for the qualitative representation of positional information in a two-dimensional space is presented. Qualitative representations use discrete quantity spaces, where a particular distinction is introduced only if it is relevant to the context being modeled. This allows us to build a flexible framework that accommodates various levels of granularity and scales of reasoning. Knowledge about position in large-scale space is commonly represented by a combination of orientation and distance relations, which we express in a particular frame of reference between a primary object and a reference object. While the representation of orientation comes out to be more straightforward, the model for distances requires that qualitative distance symbols be mapped to geometric intervals in order to be compared; this is done by defining structure relations that are able to handle, among others, order of magnitude relations; the frame of reference with its three components (distance system, scale, and type) captures the inherent context dependency of qualitative distances, The principal aim of the qualitative representation is to perform spatial reasoning: as a basic inference technique, algorithms for the composition of positional relations are developed with respect to same and different frames of reference. The model presented in this paper has potential applications in areas as diverse as Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Computer Aided Design (CAD), and Document Recognition.

459	This paper examines recent debate concerning the concepts of 'sustainable knowledge' and 'hybridity' in environmental research. Hybrid studies employ local, indigenous knowledge alongside global, scientific techniques to achieve guidelines for sustainable development. The paper discusses the value of indigenous knowledge in testing theories of environmental degradation, and the problems of overcoming socio-political constructions of environmental problems over wide time and space scales, as identified by Regional Political Ecology. The paper focuses on the so-called theory of Himalayan environmental degradation and illustrates the study with a case from northern Thailand. In Thailand, upland shifting cultivators are blamed for causing lowland sedimentation and water shortages, and have been considered by lowland communities to lack awareness of environmental degradation. The study used indigenous knowledge alongside GIS analysis and the Caesium-137 technique for measuring soil erosion to test the assumptions that land shortage has increased cultivation on steeper slopes, and that erosion is a problem for upland degradation. This is the first time these new techniques have been used in testing assumptions related to Himalayan degradation. Results indicated that upland farmers deliberately avoid erosion by increasing frequency of cultivation of flatter slopes rather than steeper slopes, and consequently the problem of erosion is overstated. However, this does not imply that their local knowledge is useful over larger areas, but instead shows the adaptability of local communities and their awareness of environmental risk. It is therefore argued that developing effective management techniques depends on differentiating more clearly between locally-based knowledge about environmental processes; politically-constructed statements about the environmental impacts of other groups; and falsifiable scientific assertions aiming to develop effective management techniques with reference to several communities.

460	Qualitative spatial reasoning is normally concerned with various methods for reasoning in images that in many cases are symbolic, like for instance, maps. The goal is to identify complex object relations by means of methods operating on a high abstraction level. Several approaches to spatial reasoning have been proposed and one such method is symbolic projection which is a qualitative reasoning technique. The method that will be discussed here is an extension of symbolic projection that specifically is concerned with the observer's point of view. In other words, the work presented here is concerned with qualitative spatial reasoning for determination of, among other things, directions, distances and other object relations seen from the observer's perspective, i.e. the projections are in the majority of cases concerned with a singular point. Furthermore, it will also be demonstrated that the slope projections introduced in this paper are a generalization of the original approach of symbolic projection.	10.1016/0031-3203(94)90165-1	WOS:A1994NR38800005	1994	Qualitative Spatial Reasoning from the Observers Point-of-View - Towards a Generalization of Symbolic Projection
461	Highlights•Community based restoration of mangroves promote mangrove management.•We used a mangrove planting Association in Ghana as a case study.•Participatory mapping was used to assess extent of mangrove cover change.•Mangrove cover increased between 1974 and 1992, but decreased from 1992 to 2010.•Economic reasons were the major motivation for mangrove replanting.\r\r\n\r\r\nEven though global interest in mangrove research has increased in recent years, unveiling their immense ecological and economic roles, very little work has been done to investigate the primary driving factors motivating long-term community-based mangrove restoration and management on local scales. In Ghana, policy makers and coastal management practitioners have recently embraced the concept of community-based and co-management of coastal and marine resources. Community-based and co-management approaches require that key stakeholders, most notably the resource users themselves, play significant roles and responsibilities in the management process. However, there is little evaluation of the process in Ghana to assess the success or otherwise, particularly of the few and long standing examples of community-based approaches in coastal resource management. With special reference to an over two decade old community-based mangrove forestry programme along the Volta estuary of Ghana, this paper provides concepts for examination of the ecological and socioeconomic factors influencing mangrove restoration and management by fishers, fish mongers, farmers and their socioeconomic groupings. Participatory GIS mapping and the use of orthophotos generated for the period 1974–2011 provided additional information on temporal evolution of the extent of mangrove areas restored and managed by local stakeholders. Socioeconomic assessment of mangrove products utility was done through questionnaire interviews. The results indicate that livelihoods and economic benefits are the primary factors that motivate local stakeholders' participation in mangrove restoration and management. Mangroves provisioning services, markets and low livelihoods diversification are major drivers of mangrove resources exploitation. The study has shown that mangroves resources can be sustainably exploited, restored and managed if local customary rules are enforced and institutional arrangements put in place to mediate mangrove exploitation and regeneration rates. Such an approach if well developed, could promote coastal resources conservation with high economic returns for the users.	10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2016.04.006	NA	2016	Community-based mangrove forest management

2	When green spaces compete with other forms of land use, especially in dense urban settings, their creation and maintenance need to be extensively justified. Very often the utilitarian arguments, such as reference to recreational uses or air quality improvement, are seen as the most convincing to illustrate the importance of green spaces for cities. However, people derive many other benefits from urban green spaces, many of which elude such a simplified practical focus. In this paper, we present an analysis of the values and important attributes that urban residents assign to green spaces. The data were collected in three cities in Poland: Krakow, Lodz and Poznan, using a public participation GIS approach an online geo-questionnair. Overall, 1640 people took part in the survey. The results exhibit a wide spectrum of values associated with urban green spaces, emphasizing the importance of the multiple cultural and anthropogenic aspects associated with urban green spaces. The study illustrates differences in the valuation of formal and informal green spaces. The latter include all the areas that are not formally demarcated or have an uncertain land tenure status. Places valued for their greenness, pleasant views, uniqueness, wild character and role as natural habitats are predominantly marked outside of formal green spaces. We highlight the challenges in the classification of urban green spaces and the need to identify and address informal green spaces in urban green space governance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

3	Obtaining useful geographic information from the flood of user-generated geographic content (UGGC) data is of significant interest, but comes with challenges in an age of crowdsourcing. To address this issue, we adopt Maslow's model of human needs to frame UGGC. Synthesizing across literature about volunteered geographic information and participatory GIS, we present a conceptual framework for characterizing collection of UGGC. The framework is composed of multiple dimensions and levels that include perspectives about motivations, participatory methods, and participants. We also articulate four levels of participants (stakeholders, core-engaged participants, semi-core-engaged participants, and engaged citizens) together with four work principles (communication, cooperation, coordination, and collaboration). Finally, a case study describes an example we use to evaluate the conceptual framework for its suitability in design of a UGGC system. We conclude by reflecting on how and why this framework offers a valuable perspective for deriving useful geographic information and offer future research directions.	10.1080/15230406.2016.1163644	2017
4	It is essential to ensure equal accessibility to services, such as sport and recreation facilities or green and water environments. Differences in accessibility can potentially cause negative health and social welfare implications. Accessibility and service area analyses from the perspective of access equality are typically rather simple. They are often based on arbitrary travel-distance thresholds and made only with a single mode of transport in mind. Thus, they exclude the multidimensional nature of accessibility where individuals' travel behavior and perceived accessibility also play an important role. In this paper, a PPGIS method was used to empirically investigate distances and durations that respondents travel with different modes of transport to access popular water environments. Service area analyses were built on person-based and objectively measured threshold values that not only take into account the spatio-temporal elements of transport networks and a land use component but also recognize the requirements and preferences of individuals and their capacity to access and participate. The results showed that the most common mode of transport to access waters is walking. Generally, the residents travel by foot for 1.7 km to access water environments. Cars were found as the second most common mode of transport used, and most of the popular water environments are accessible by car from every corner of the study area in a given travel threshold time. The results demonstrate the importance of deriving local parameters and the potential of the PPGIS approach for accessibility and service area delineation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

5	Parks and protected areas provide a wide range of benefits, but methods to evaluate their importance to society are often ad hoc and limited. In this study, the quality of crowdsourced information from Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) sources (Flickr, OpenStreetMap (OSM), and Wikipedia) was compared with visitor counts that are presumed to reflect social importance. Using the state of Victoria, Australia as a case study, secondary crowdsourced VGI data, primary crowdsourced (PPGIS data) and visitor statistics were examined for their correspondence and differences, and to identify spatial patterns in park popularity. Data completeness the percent of protected areas with data varied between sources, being highest for OSM (90%), followed by Flickr (41%), PPGIS (24%), visitation counts (5%), and Wikipedia articles (4%). Statistically significant correlations were found between all five measures of popularity for protected areas. Using stepwise multiple linear regression, the explained variability in visitor numbers was greater than 70%, with PPGIS, Flickr and OSM having the largest standardized coefficients. The social importance of protected areas varied as a function of accessibility and the types of values (direct or indirect use) expressed for the areas. Crowdsourced data may provide an alternative to visitor counts for assessing protected area social importance and spatial variability of visitation. However, crowdsourced data appears to be an unreliable proxy for the full range of values and importance of protected areas, especially for non-use values such as biological conservation.

10	Recent shifts in web map technology away from proprietary software and toward development on the Open Web Platform have increased the number and complexity of technical skills needed to do cartography on the Web. Web-based cartography curricula likewise must be adapted to prepare geography, cartography, and GIS students with the skills needed to make use of open source technology. This paper describes the design and evaluation of anovel curriculum for the laboratory component of a web mapping course offered by a university geography department. We drew from constructivist educational theory to create a scaffolded and spiralled lab curriculum that builds on prior understanding and progressively increases student independence and confidence. We evaluated the success of the new curriculum through an instructor log, student feedback on assignments, and an exit survey. The evaluation revealed significant growth in student abilities and confidence in the use of Open Web Platform-based mapping tools as a result of the curriculum scaffolding. This research provides a methodology for designing and evaluating curriculum around highly technical skills that are increasingly in demand in research, education, and industry careers.	10.1080/03098265.2016.1241987	2017
6	Participatory mapping in social research is characterized by methodological pluralism, with two common methods being qualitative mapping using stakeholder interviews and quantitative methods that engage larger public samples through digital, internet mapping. To date, there has been no systematic evaluation of the extent to which mixed methods in participatory mapping yield valid results when applied to the same research setting and research questions. A mixed methods research design (combined exploratory sequential and convergent parallel) was implemented in a large research project to identify marine and coastal values in the Kimberley region of Australia. Qualitative interviews (n = 167) were completed with stakeholders to identify place-based values using polygon mapping methods and internet-based public participation GIS-(PPGIS) methods (n = 578). We defined and operationalized the concepts of concurrent, commensurate, and convergent validity to assess mixed methods research outcomes. We found that qualitative and quantitative methods resulted in moderate to high concurrent validity when assessing the importance of place values in the study area. Convergent validity (spatial) was highly variable by place value, with stronger convergent validity found with mapped aesthetic, recreational fishing, tourism, biodiversity, and Aboriginal culture values, and weakest with existence, therapeutic, and commercial fishing values. Convergent validity was influenced by weak commensurate validity through the use of different geometric features (polygons versus points) for mapping values across a large study area. The utility of mixed methods for planning decision support in a convergent parallel design depends on demonstrating convergence in construct meaning, spatial location, and consistency in values in the sampling populations.

7	Features of the physical environment have an impact on the human behaviour. Thus, planners and policymakers around the world should aim at providing environments that are perceived as being of good quality, inwhich the residents enjoy spending time and moving around in. It iswidely acknowledged that urban environmental quality associateswith well-being, but there is currently very little research examining which features of urban environments people of different ages perceive as appealing in their living environments. Individuals experience different age-related developmental environments throughout their life course. Thus, the usage and perceptions of different spaces can also differ between various age groups. Public Participation GIS datasets collected in 2009 and 2011 in Helsinki Metropolitan Area were used to study places perceived as being positive by adults (n= 3119) and children (n= 672). Participants marked points on a map that were overlaid with GIS data to study whether the physical environment of positive places of different age groups differed. The results demonstrated that the physical environment differs significantly in the positive places of different age groups. The places of adult age groupswere characterized by green, blue and commercial spaces, whereas sports, residential and commercial spaces characterize children's and adolescents' places. Older adults' places were found to be closest to home, while adolescents' places were the most distant. Providing appealing environments for all age groups in one setting remains problematic but should nevertheless be strived for, especially in the urban context where a constant competition over different usages of space occurs.

8	Global interest in participatory mapping described as public participation GIS (PPGIS), participatory GIS (PGIS), and volunteered geographic information (VGI) continues to grow, but systematic study of spatial data quality and sampling effects is limited. This article provides a review and meta-analysis of Internet-based PPGIS studies conducted during the period 2006-2015 (n=26) to answer the following research questions: (1) How does mapping effort, as a proxy measure for spatial data quality, differ by sampling group? (2) Does the purpose and context of PPGIS influence mapping results? (3) What is the potential for mapping bias through sampling design? (4) Given the results, what should be the focus of future PPGIS research? Mapping effort was highest in sampling groups whose livelihoods were closely related to the purpose of the study, there was greater mapping effort in household sampling groups compared to volunteer groups, and participant domicile had strong effects on mapped results through spatial discounting. The use of online Internet panels provides higher response rates but lower spatial data quality. Future research should focus on increasing sampling response rates, assessing social trade-offs using alternative spatial weighting schemes, and examining the capacity of the public to select land use alternatives as a complement to traditional expert-driven planning systems.	10.1111/tgis.12207	2017
9	This article applies Geographic Information Technologies (GIT) to the field of Cultural Heritage (CH), aiming to analyse patrimonial valuation through Digital Representations (DR). It seeks to briefly introduce the importance of DR through the concepts of the individual's spatial cognition (mental) and physical (external) perceptions. It approaches the main topics of 3D data acquisition, modelling and visualisation, as well as cultural heritage applications, and presents 3D and Augmented Reality (AR) trials, together with their main results and discussion. The methodology consists of exploratory data acquisition using terrestrial and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), 3D modelling procedures, and the integration between 3D-Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and AR environments (mobile platforms) applied to patrimonial systems and elements in urban areas. The results consist of several Trials and products of 3D acquisition and modelling processes to be visualised in an AR environment. These allow for adjusting the core solutions for further mobile application development. Taking the ancient Lisbon (Aqueduct) water supply system (classified as a national monument) as a case study, the fact that most of it is imperceptible, owing to the large extent of the undergrown galleries, enables the onsite visualisation of the relation between the system and the city elements within a mixed reality environment. The methods used aimed to strengthen the idea of the potential application of this technology for heritage valuation, associating the use of geographic information to fields commonly related to a strong visual perception of space, providing essential data not only for occasional users (public), but also for specialised technicians, opinion/decision makers, promoters and other stakeholders.	10.5821/ace.11.33.4686	2017
226	Web 2.0 technologies including Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) provide methods for engaging multiple publics in public lands management. We examined the effects of sampling in a PPGIS/VGI application for national forest planning in the US. A random sample (RS) of households and a volunteer public (VP) were invited to participate in an internet-based PPGIS to identify national forest values and use preferences. Spatial and non-spatial group responses were analysed. The VP group expressed stronger utilitarian values and consumptive use preferences while the RS group preferred forest amenities. These results would lead to different planning decisions. PPGIS/VGI methods should include scientific sampling to ground-truth voluntary participation.	10.1080/09640568.2012.741045	2014
11	Green space at different distances is important for the wellbeing of urban dwellers. However, since these different types of green space are, for the most part, investigated in separate studies, it is difficult to disentangle how the use and appreciation of nearby and more distant nature by urban dwellers is related. To address this issue, we conduct an analysis in which we directly compare the appreciation and use of green spaces at four different spatial levels: neighbourhood, region, national, and world level, for urban residents in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. For this we use a quantitative, internet-based, participatory GIS method. The relationship between the use of local and more distant green spaces by urban dwellers has generally been addressed in terms of compensation. Our results indicate that this relationship can also be viewed in a complementary way. Urban residents appear to have a 'portfolio of natural places'. This portfolio consists of favourite places nearby that are rated lower but visited quite often, and natural places that they find highly attractive but are located farther away and visited less often. Local favourite places offer basic access to green and nature while other more distant natural places offer a larger variety of qualities and recreational possibilities. Results also indicate that, in order to meet the needs of urban residents, more than the immediate urban context needs to be considered in urban planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

12	Early advocates of Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) envisioned a future in which members of the public (broadly) and members of marginalized communities (specifically) would utilize geographic information and spatial technologies to affect positive change within their communities. Yet in spite of the emergence and success of PPGIS, open source geospatial tools, and the geoweb, access barriers recognized by proponents of PPGIS in the mid-1990s persist. As a result, PPGIS facilitators continue to be instrumental in addressing access barriers to geospatial technologies among resource poor organizations and marginalized groups. 'Community geography', is a growing area of academic geography that leverages university community partnerships to facilitate access to spatial technology, data, and analysis. Experiences from community geography programmes at three universities (Chicago State University, Syracuse University, and Columbus State University) demonstrate the benefits and challenges of a facilitated model of PPGIS.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1244322	2017
13	Similarity between the objects has close association with the geometrical structure and details of the objects. Therefore, in this study, a framework was presented based on the geometric criteria, the fuzzy Membership Functions (MF) and human spatial cognition. To increase the efficiency of MF and for the problem to get closer to reality, 1 K, 2 K, 5 K, 10 K, 25 K, 50 K, and 100 K data were used in this framework. The results showed that the degree of spatial similarity is specific to the objects themselves and their geometric structure. No linear or non-linear relationship could be found between scale changes and degree of spatial similarity of the objects, because the geometry of any object independently affects its degree of similarity to other objects in different scales and sources.	10.1080/10106049.2016.1155659	2017
14	Despite myriad studies having been carried out on the diffusion of geographical information systems (GIS) technology, only a limited number have been done within the context of developing countries. This paper addresses the research question, how did the diffusion of GIS technology occur in Uganda? Mixed methods were used for data collection, and analysis was performed using a theoretical framework called the diffusion of innovations (DOI). The results of the study showed that the adoption of GIS by institutions in Uganda occurred in a classic diffusion pattern consistent with diffusion theory. Adoption of GIS was promoted by its relative advantage over, and compatibility with, existing technologies. It was characterized by both heterophilous and homophilous communication channels, and influenced by change agents and champions. Its rate of adoption followed an S-shaped diffusion curve, and was hampered by bureaucracy, and patronage-based societal norms. This study makes a contribution to literature on GIS diffusion in developing countries.	10.1080/13658816.2016.1242131	2017
15	This paper describes the findings of a novel participatory geographic information systems (PGISs) methodology designed to support vulnerability and disaster risk management (DRM) efforts in small Caribbean communities. The methodology combines community vulnerability mapping with geo-referenced household data through a step-by-step approach to record information on household vulnerability and community hazards. We used partial PGIS to demonstrate the benefits of implementing a participatory mapping technique with an external facilitator who undertook the technical geographic information system aspects of the mapping process. Results show that as a tool for knowledge co-production and stakeholder engagement, PGIS can be useful to record local spatial knowledge on vulnerability and hazards whilst supporting the development of risk and vulnerability reduction measures. By helping community members understand and manage vulnerability, this approach has the potential to become an important mechanism to support vulnerability reduction and DRM strategies in small Caribbean communities. Following the approach described in this paper, similar activities can be easily replicated in other parts of the world.	10.1080/17565529.2015.1067593	2017
16	Participatory approaches elicit information from multiple stakeholders while planning and implementing resource management systems. Such elicited information is often associated with significant variability. Public participation geographical information science (GIS) (PP-GIS) solutions can reduce this variability by helping stakeholders to measure the factors involved and provide the elicited information. We propose a Quality Function Deployment'-based participatory framework for developing such PP-GIS solutions. It is demonstrated using a case study to enhance an existing PP-GIS into a solution for rainwater harvesting systems in Indian villages. The novelty of the proposed framework is that it identifies metrics and carries out comparative analysis of three existing solutions: participatory rural appraisal, participatory mapping and PP-GIS. In the case study, PP-GIS scored less than participatory mapping as it scored less on usability and affordability. To improve PP-GIS in these aspects, an easy-to-use mobile and web based, free and open source PP-GIS solution, Watershed GIS, was developed. It scored better than the three existing solutions and its usage resulted in substantial reduction of variability in criteria values and thus better ranking of alternatives, with the average coefficient of variation decreasing from 0.12 to 0.05.	10.1080/13658816.2016.1206202	2017
17	Data for biophysically modeled and Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS)-derived cultural ecosystem services have potential to identify natural resource management synergies and conflicts, but have rarely been combined. Ecosystem service hot/coldspots generated using different methods vary in their spatial extent and connectivity, with important implications. We map biophysically modeled and PPGIS-derived cultural services for six U.S. national forests using six hot/coldspot delineation methods. We evaluate the implications of hotspot methods for management within and outside of designated wilderness areas. We used the ARIES and SolVES modeling tools to quantify four biophysically modeled and 11 largely cultural ecosystem services for six national forests in Colorado and Wyoming, USA. We mapped hot/coldspots using two quantile methods (top and bottom 10 and 33 % of values), two area-based methods (top and bottom 10 and 33 % of area), and two statistical methods (Getis-Ord Gi* at alpha = 0.05 and 0.10 significance level) and compare results within and outside wilderness areas. Delineation methods vary in their degree of conservatism for hot/coldspot extents and spatial clustering. Hotspots were more common in wilderness areas in national forests near the more densely populated Colorado Front Range, while coldspots were more common in wilderness areas in more urban-distant forests in northwest Wyoming. Statistical hotspot methods of intermediate conservatism (i.e., Getis-Ord Gi*, alpha = 0.10 significance) may be most useful for ecosystem service hot/coldspot mapping to inform landscape scale planning. We also found spatially explicit evidence in support of past findings about public attitudes toward wilderness areas.	10.1007/s10980-016-0430-6	2017
18	In this paper we explore notions of within-group language variation in a Tzotzil Maya town of Chiapas, Mexico. Integrating GIS mapping, cultural domain analysis, and ethnographic research we find that the Tzotzil of Chenalho hold a center-diffusion model of language variation in their municipality. We show that, counter to dichotomous models of identity, people see variation between communities as continuous and use spatial distances as a proxy for estimating linguistic differences. However, contrary to our expectations, people do not estimate linguistic distances from their own community; instead, they use the presumed pre-conquest center of the larger ethnic group as a point of reference from which variation emerges. Estimations are further influenced by a notion of a linguistically homogeneous center as well as by socio-political knowledge and stereotypes. These findings suggest that spatial cognition, combined with social and historical factors, may play a pivotal role in processes of identity formation and maintenance. Linguistic ideologies inscribe both deeply buried histories as well as people's conceptualization of space and their place in it. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

19	Readily available high resolution data on population distribution is an important resource for monitoring human environment interactions and for supporting planning and management decisions. Using a grid that approximates population density over the entire country seems like the most practical approach to exploring and distributing detailed population data but instead data based on census aggregation units is still the most widely used method. In this paper we describe the construction of 30 m resolution grid representing the distribution of population in 2010 over the entire conterminous United States. The grid is computed using 2010 U.S. Census block level population counts disaggregated by a dasymetric model that uses land cover (2011 NLCD) and land use (2010 NLUD) as ancillary data. Detailed descriptions of the ancillary data and dasymetric model are given. Methods of computing the grid are presented followed by an extensive assessment of model accuracy. Overall the expected value for relative error of the model is 44% which is at the lower limit of errors reported for other continental-sized, high resolution population grids. We also offer a more specific error estimate for areas with specified value of population density. Using two example areas, one highly urbanized and another rural, we demonstrate the advantages of using the gridded population data over the census block-based data. Our 30 m population grid is available for online exploration and for download from the custom-made GeoWeb application SocScape at http://sil.uc.edu. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

20	Most current approaches focused on vulnerability, resilience, and adaptation to climate change frame gender and its influence in a manner out-of-step with contemporary academic and international development research. The tendency to rely on analyses of the sex-disaggregated gender categories of 'men' and 'women' as sole or principal divisions explaining the abilities of different people within a group to adapt to climate change, illustrates this problem. This framing of gender persists in spite of established bodies of knowledge that show how roles and responsibilities that influence a person's ability to deal with climate-induced and other stressors emerge at the intersection of diverse identity categories, including but not limited to gender, age, seniority, ethnicity, marital status, and livelihoods. Here, we provide a review of relevant literature on this topic and argue that approaching vulnerability to climate change through intersectional understandings of identity can help improve adaptation programming, project design, implementation, and outcomes.	10.1007/s13280-016-0827-0	2016
21	This paper examines the outcomes of a Geodesign approach to training undergraduates and graduate students in environmental design and related professions. The focus of this paper is on the role of Geode sign in generalist environmental design training. This paper is organized in three parts. First, it describes a conceptual framework for Geodesign that seats it within a context of theory and practice. Second, we present a case study of the University of Colorado Geodesign program, including, at the time under review in this case, undergraduate and masters programs in architecture, landscape architecture and planning. Third, we reflect back both on the conceptual framework and the experience of the University of Colorado. In this research we developed an instrument with which to evaluate final class projects, and assess learning outcomes of beginning and advanced studios, special topics classes and Geodesign modules. While a number of Geodesign programs are underway relatively little has been written about Geodesign pedagogy. This paper explores issues and opportunities in Geodesign education based on the University of Colorado case. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.05.010	2016
22	The sociocultural approach attempts to compensate for values that tend to be obscured by economic valuations of ecosystem services. GIS-based public participation tools are expected to be useful to include public perception into the ecosystem assessments, but there are still problems transforming qualitative information into quantitative values in practical use. This study evaluated stakeholders' subjective valuations of ecosystem service bundles in relation to biophysical and socioeconomic factors in a subject-applicable study area. A mail-based survey was conducted by sending questionnaires to communities in the Kushiro watershed, northern Japan. The respondents were asked to allocate a virtual fund to 10 individual ecosystem services for potential land management and indicate the locations corresponding to their preferred management measures on a provided map. Respondents highly valued provisioning and cultural services, followed by regulating and supporting services. The results of Tobit models indicated the correlational influence of respondents' characteristics and familiarity with the surrounding environment. In addition, the results of a spatial analysis depicted a considerable degree of spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of the perceived values in relation to landscape structures. Thus, social values of ecosystem service bundles should be analyzed from the perspectives of diverse stakeholders representing a variety of socioecological contexts.	10.1016/j.ecoser.2016.10.009	2016
23	This essay offers paths for scholars influenced by the critical social sciences and theoretical humanities to contribute to the construction of concepts and digital practices of data that will allow data to better align with their approaches to scholarly inquiry. In particular, it explores how geographic information might be refashioned, rereading it from simplified theoretical positions drawn from interpretative inquiry, process-relational thought, and new materialisms. Geographic information has largely called forth self-sufficient entities that have intensive properties, are indexed by location in an absolute space, and are known objectively through a geographic gaze. By contrast, this article suggests ways geographic information may be reimagined to constitute spaces as relational, matter as vibrant, and/or knowledge as situated. If all claims are seen as interpretative, the boundaries between what were previously considered the roles for reader, researcher, data structures, observer, and observed may also need to be reordered, with implications for the ways that we interface with data. Although such paths can be difficult to travel, they hold promise for extending the reach of interpretative and (non-positivist) empirical practice as well as favorably altering the terms on which interpretative scholars can participate in debates around, and practices of, data today.	10.1177/0263775816665118	2016
24	Underground utility incidents, such as utility conflicts and utility strikes, result in time and cost overruns in construction projects, property damages, environmental pollution, personnel injuries, and fatalities. A main cause of recurrent utility incidents is the noncompliance with the spatial configurations between utilities and their surroundings. Utility specifications usually contain textual descriptions of the spatial configurations. However, detection of spatial defects, according to the textual descriptions, is difficult and time consuming. This deficiency is because of the lack of spatial cognition in many rule-checking systems to process massive amounts of data. This study aims to automate utility compliance checking by integrating natural language processing (NLP) and spatial reasoning. NLP algorithm translates the textual descriptions of spatial configurations into computer-processable spatial rules. Spatial reasoning executes the extracted spatial rules following a logical order in a geographical information system (GIS) to identify noncompliance. The intellectual contribution of this study is twofold. First, complex spatial rules are retrieved automatically from textual data with their hierarchies classified, which provides the inputs and indicates the sequence of rule execution in spatial reasoning. Second, semantic spatial relations are modeled on the basis of their metric and topological implications, enabling the automatic execution of multiple spatial rules. Experiments were conducted to test this framework. The average precision, recall, and combination of the two (F-measure) achieved by the NLP algorithm for extracting spatial rules are 87.88%, 79.09%, and 83.25%, respectively. In addition, the spatial reasoning mechanism also was found to be a powerful tool for compliance checking under various scenarios.	10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001199	2016
25	From nano-plastics to large sunken vessels, marine debris presents a threat to humans and ecosystems worldwide. Fishermen's knowledge of the sources of, and risks posed by medium to large debris derived from fishing, aquaculture, and other marine industries provides important context for debris mitigation. Public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) can address these risks by integrating subjective and objective spatial data on human and environmental impacts and risks. We integrated fishermen's perceptions and experiences with marine debris with spatial data using PPGIS. We developed a georeferenced database of fishermen's experiences with marine debris, collected during focus groups and at various other meetings in Southwest New Brunswick. This layer was used to integrate baseline data with subjective perceptions of the ecological, economic, and navigational risks associated with marine debris in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. We also documented the physical, technical, political, and regulatory challenges to marine debris mitigation. These challenges highlight the social and environmental processes that complicate any projects that attempt to develop uncontested spatial representations of marine debris. Finally, we discuss the potential of PPGIS to address these challenges by fostering communication, coordinating various marine activities, helping stakeholders set priorities for clean-up, and implementing collaborative clean-up projects.

43	Children's time and freedom for independent neighbourhood activity is severely declining, which may be adversely impacting their healthy development. This study integrates GPS activity monitoring and environmental analysis in a geographic information system with activity diaries, annotated maps, surveys, and map-enhanced interviews to conduct a deep pattern analysis of children's habitual neighbourhood behaviour (n=23; aged 9-13 years) from each an urban and suburban school neighbourhood within London, Canada. Patterns in children's primary activities and settings, independent mobility (IM) levels, and perception and use of neighbourhood affordances are examined. Participants note a diverse range of local independent destinations, but habitually spend little time playing outdoors in neighbourhoods. Local activity related to free time available, perception of activity affordances, and license to travel independently. Social and environmental conditions of children's micro-neighbourhoods influenced independent destinations and domains. Neighbourhood planning should promote diversity of activity affordances and address conditions that support increased IM for youth.	10.1080/14733285.2016.1140126	2016
28	Ever since behavioural geographers started working with place perception; and Peter Gould and Kevin Lynch used mental maps to explore city visualization and spatial preferences, participation has become an integral part of geographical research. Later, when Robert Chambers and others introduced maps into Participatory Rural Appraisal, Participatory GIS and Public Participation GIS were also recognized by quantitative geographers as research methods and visualization tools. In the era of smartphones and global Internet coverage, applications such as FixMyStreet, ArcGIS Online, CartoDB and Maptioannaire allow users to cross the technology gap and become neocartographers without the need for GIS knowledge. GeoParticipation based on using spatial tools in order to involve citizens in community participation can be the future development of Public Participation GIS as it provides an easy-to-use environment and social engagement while creating the feeling of belonging to a certain social group or community. The paper presents a historical review of participatory approaches to the creation of maps, while focusing on the changing role of citizens; from being the objects of geographical research to being the creators of the agenda as well as decision-makers within their communities. Maps were always used as tools of power, but there is a visible shift in the (map) power structures, from maps created by experts and state administration representatives towards maps created by people and their users.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1243862	2016
29	This paper reviews persistent principles of participation processes. On the basis of a review of recent interrogations of the (Public) Participatory Geographic Information Systems (P)PGIS and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) approaches, a summary of five prevailing principles in participatory spatial information handling is presented. We investigate these five principles that are common to (P) PGIS and VGI on the basis of a framework of two dimensions that govern the participatory use of spatial information from the perspective of people and society. This framework is presented as a shared perspective of (P) PGIS and VGI and illustrates that, although both share many of these same principles, the ways in which these principles are approached are highly diverse. The paper ends with a future outlook in which we discuss the inter-connected memes of potential technological futures, the signification of localness in 'local spatial knowledge', and the ramifications of ethical tenets by which PGIS and VGI can strengthen each other as two sides of the same coin.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1227552	2016
30	Participatory GIS (PGIS) was borne out of the cauldron of the GIS and Society debates and the social theoretic critique of GIS. The form and practice of PGIS continues to reflect its origins. At its core PGIS remains focused on integrating local knowledge that is multivalent, equivocal, and often conflictual within a reductionist GIS technology and extensive Spatial Data Infrastructure. Recent conceptual developments in deep mapping and spatial storytelling have the potential to advance the representation of community knowledge through participatory deep mapping. Deep mapping explicitly recognizes that social life is contingent, implicated, and unpredictable. In representing a critical engagement between Geographic Information Science (GISc) and community knowledge and representation, deep mapping potentially challenges the misalignment in representing community knowledge in GIS and in bending geospatial technologies to the needs of communities.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1243864	2016
31	This article will focus on the changes in time, technology and data that have affected traditional partner relationships using participatory geographic information systems (PGIS). Project development roles of reliance held by the community, and managed by university agents, has shifted from cooperative to, in some cases, complete independence. The modern model of citizen participation includes a resident-planner toolkit with greater access to neighbourhood data and low-to high-tech analytical tools. Many community-led quality of life studies have a limited scope and focus on policy issues that do not serve a larger constituency. Many neighbourhood plans exclude self-reported neighbourhood knowledge and, due to the frequency of municipal reporting cycles, leaves gaps and data mismatch. Given this, the traditional public participation GIS (PPGIS) model may be less data driven due to a more mission-driven resident-led PGIS solution. Planners in practice and in academia have raised levels of concern about data standards, interoperability, reliability, error and metadata. How and why Citizen Science influenced the progression of PPGIS, participation GIS, crowdsourcing and now community-managed data in both theory and practice are provided. This paper will reflect on how top-down strategies to include neighbourhood knowledge are being reframed by the United States Federal Community of Practice. The future of data integration focuses on both the process and products of data development from both the bottom-up and top-down perspectives.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1243863	2016
32	Since 1996, participatory GIS (PGIS) has facilitated avenues through which public participation can occur. One of the ways practitioners articulate social change associated with PGIS interventions has been to qualify success using the term 'empowerment'. This paper explores the extent to which PGIS academic literature has utilised, defined, measured, and analysed empowerment. This research will demonstrate the degree to which PGIS has, from 1996 to 2014, appropriately and adequately taken into account the causative and direct relationship between a PGIS intervention and empowerment. This article identifies works broadly dealing with PGIS, then searches within that subset of literature for the term 'empowerment.' The findings are both quantitatively and qualitatively assessed to explore the trends within the PGIS literature over time and to contextualise the ways in which empowerment has been identified, understood, and articulated. We conclude with a discussion on the extent to which future PGIS research and practice has the ability to disrupt power inequalities.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1209624	2016
33	Equitable access to local geospatial data continues to pose challenges to the knowledge production efforts of marginalized citizen groups. While local government agencies have provided greater access to public data sets through their internet Geographic Information System (GIS) sites, data cannot always be downloaded and used directly by citizens. Past research demonstrates that data sharing at the local level can be a challenging task, mired by legal, institutional, and personal issues. Despite the hype about open data in government, its acceptance and implementation is slow at the local scale. The need for a centralized data repository system at the local scale is thus crucial. This research explores the recent groundbreaking effort to establish a state-wide geospatial portal among the 26 University of Wisconsin (UW) library systems. Through a survey and follow up interviews conducted among public land information professionals in Wisconsin, we find that GIS professionals in local and county governments are open to data sharing through a common geospatial portal. Simultaneously, the efforts to introduce open source GIS software and technical skills through workshops conducted by the library staff demonstrate new ways to facilitate Public Participation GIS (PPGIS). Our research thus demonstrates that university libraries can emerge as an effective model for advancing PPGIS through geoportals, web services, and data and applications in the cloud.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1227567	2016
34	Mapping spatial information to represent indigenous knowledge (IK) and rights has been taking place since the early 1970s in various parts of Canada. These mapping initiatives continue to be primarily associated with traditional land-use (TLU) studies and have deep roots in participatory methods that include aspects of participatory geographic information systems (PGIS). In the current context of encroaching industrial developments into indigenous homelands and the strengthening of Indigenous rights within Canadian Supreme Court rulings, the role of mapping TLU information is central. Who is conducting the research, what tools are used, and how this information is shared are all key questions being asked in the Indigenous context. As a result, the quality of spatial data has become a critical part of these engagement processes. This paper focuses on the intersections of new methods of TLU/IK data collection, namely a direct-to-digital approach that seeks to minimize misrepresentation and mistranslations of IK. From these intersections, the authors recognize the need to establish Indigenous-led quality indicators that directly address the introduction of new methods into the TLU/IK field. Indigenous geographic information and spatial data quality indicators will better address the current needs of Indigenous communities in the negotiation of resource developments in their territories, and provide a new path forward for enhancing the use of geospatial technologies in Indigenous communities.	10.1080/00087041.2016.1190146	2016
35	Social environmental injustice could directly influence children's physical activity and weight, but also indirectly through changing their psychosocial processes. This study aims to assess spatially continuous physical and social environments and to examine the impact of psychosocial stress on the complex interaction between children and obesogenic environments in three Eastern Alabama counties. The obesogenic environment is defined with particular physical, social, and economic characteristics, causing higher risk of being overweight or obese. Survey questionnaires were collected for 690 children in grades K-6 at six schools to measure children's weight, height, socio-demographics, and home locations. Physical activity, psychosocial stress, and family environment were further gathered from a subsample of children aged 8-13 (n = 65) through extended surveys. GIS and statistical methods were used to assess multilevel environments at family, community, and school levels. The associations between children's physical activity, stress, weight, and physical and social environments were examined by a series of multi-level regression models. Of the sample, 42.3% of the participants were measured as Overweight or obese, much higher than the national rate of 31.8%. High weight clusters were observed in a variety of block groups with diverse physical and social environments. Community physical and social environments exhibited inconsistent even opposite spatial patterns (r = -0.18; p < 0.05). The results of multilevel regression models demonstrated the bidirectional causal interactions of physical activity, psycho social stress, and weight. We also found that family (p < 0.01) and school environments (p < 0.01) were more influential to children's participation in physical activity, psychological wellbeing, and weight status compared to community environments.

36	Marine protected area (MPA) research continues to be dominated by biophysical interests. However, understanding social data, including people's values and preferences, is critical to both effective planning and management and long-term MPA success. Having these social data in a spatial form is essential, given that MPA planning and management increasingly uses marine spatial planning (MSP) approaches to carefully locate and mediate among potentially competing uses in both space and time. An online Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) survey was used to collect spatially explicit information on stakeholder values and management preferences for Australia's remote Kimberley region. The Kimberley coast and marine environment is characterised by a multiplicity of values and preferences. Key values included biological conservation, aesthetics, recreational fishing, Aboriginal culture and heritage, and nature based tourism. Management preferences were dominated by the desire to increase conservation/protection, exclude oil/gas development and commercial fishing, and to increase Aboriginal management. The diversity of values and preferences present suggests potential for conflict over management and permitted uses. Significant associations between value and preference distribution and the Kimberley's five marine protected areas were analysed. Accessibility and respondent familiarity appear linked to value attribution. More accessible MPAs were significantly associated with recreation values while more remote MPAs were characterised by a conservation ethos and general aversion to development. Our research demonstrates that PPGIS enables documentation of spatially explicit social data across large scales, highlighting potential synergies and conflicts in values and permitted uses, in a manner that can readily integrate with ecologically based marine spatial planning processes.

37	Neogeography is the name given to the phenomenon of the vastly expanded Geographic Information Systems (GIS) user base. It consists of a collection of practices, tools and users generally found outside of traditional, authoritative GIS. GIS are computer applications that allow users to contribute geotagged data and to access and utilize geospatial data sets in combination with attribute information for a variety of purposes. This paper investigates questions of whether neogeography furthers the democratization of GIS and if increased access translates to empowerment or, conversely, to further marginalization. The research is interpretative and involves a literature review of the topic and a metasynthesis of recent qualitative research. Metasynthesis involves critical evaluation of data to identify an appropriate research sample and synthesis of findings by a compare-and-contrast exercise followed by reciprocal translation of each study into the other studies to reveal overarching metaphors. This is followed by conclusions and recommendations. The findings show that, depending on circumstances, neogeography can result in the democratization of GIS and geospatial data but may also constitute new methods of exclusion depending on technological and societal barriers. Neogeography can also result in empowerment, but this is difficult to define and is often highly contingent on local context.	10.1080/1369118X.2015.1125936	2016
60	An Internet-based public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) is an affordable and accessible tool for citizens to provide location-based volunteered geographic information (VGI) in environmental planning and management. Based on a conceptual model, this study uses the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis methodology to qualitatively evaluate user, information, and site use of six cases with Internet-based PPGIS. This study reviews each case's website to collect descriptive data for the case analysis. The results of this study show that user numbers do not have a significantly strong relationship with data submission numbers, since active users had the highest number of contributions. The most urgent task of using Internet-based PPGIS to attract citizen scientists is to invite and retain long-term and active contributors, and to change interested users into long-term active contributors.	10.1080/09640568.2015.1054477	2016
38	A significant barrier to the assessment of ecosystem services is a lack of primary data, especially for cultural ecosystem services. Spatial value transfer, also known as benefits transfer, is a method to identify the probable locations of ecosystem services based on empirical spatial associations found in other geographic locations. To date, there has been no systematic evaluation of spatial value transfer methods for cultural ecosystem services identified through participatory mapping methods. This research paper addresses this knowledge gap by examining key variables that influence value transfer for cultural ecosystem services: (1) the geographic setting, (2) the type of ecosystem services, and (3) the land cover data selected for value-transfer. Spatial data from public participation GIS (PPGIS) processes in two regions in Norway were used to evaluate spatial value transfer where the actual mapped distribution of cultural ecosystem values were compared to maps generated using value transfer coefficients. Six cultural ecosystem values were evaluated using two different land cover classification systems GlobCover (300 m resolution) and CORINE (100 m resolution). Value transfer maps based on the distribution of mapped ecosystem values produced strongly correlated results to primary data in both regions. Value transfer for cultural ecosystems appear valid under conditions where the primary data and value transfer regions have similar physical landscapes, the social and cultural values of the human populations are similar, and the primary data sample sizes are large and unbiased. We suggest the use of non-economic value transfer coefficients derived from participatory mapping as the current best approach for estimating the importance and spatial distribution of cultural ecosystem services.

39	The transition from single-media, single-location, and single point-in-time analysis to a Cumulative approach represents a profound challenge - and opportunity - for policy makers, planners, advocates and researchers. These challenges and opportunities are, in part, methodological (e.g., data availability of pollution sources, uncertainty of chemical reactions among multiple pollutants, evaluating combined health effects of multiple environmental stressors). However, the social complexity of this issue has been acknowledged, but not systematically documented and analyzed. As a result, there is a significant gap between the development of cumulative impacts analysis and a limited ability to reap their benefit in resolving environmental justice conflicts. Framing cumulative impacts as a \\wicked problem\\" can help highlight some of the challenges in implementing such approaches and can point the way towards applying these approaches to improving collaboration between policy makers, planners, and advocates. We present two case studies of cumulative impacts analysis in California using socio-spatial mapping and public participatory geographic information system (PPGIS). These cases will illustrate the challenges and opportunities for combining quantitative and socio-spatial science with PPGIS as strategies to address the wicked nature of assessing and acting to address cumulative environmental impacts. The Case studies will emphasize the value of an adaptive, participatory, and transdisciplinary approach as an effective response to the wicked qualities of cumulative impacts themselves. These cases can help planners, policy makers, and community advocates to apply a cumulative impacts approach to their own wicked problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

40	The goal of the present paper is to analyze spatial overlap and social conflicts between mountain bikers and runners in an Urban Green Park. The methodology uses publicly available volunteer geographic information, compiled in a spatial database with places (tracks) where these activities occur, in order to measure the use intensity. Results show: (1) the rate of biker and runner compliance with the park's trails, and (2) places where potential conflicts among users are likely to happen. Profiling user's preferences can help managers and decision makers to design proper infrastructure for outdoor activities. Strategic management errors can be avoided by knowing user preferences in urban parks, and by offering improved conditions which meet the expectations and needs of different user groups. MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS This paper presents an efficient method to detect spatial overlaps between different recreational activities which is useful when financial and personnel resources for monitoring visitors in recreational urban green areas are scarce. The dataset comprises Volunteer Geographic Information, publicly available through web sharing services. It constitutes an alternative or a complementary data base compared to direct survey methods. The study revealed the suitability of this methodological approach for the two most popular outdoor recreation activities within urban parks - mountain biking and running. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

41	In order to address the increasing need for improved linkages between different value perspectives, we examine the possibility of integrating two valuation methods: the non-monetary softGlS and monetary hedonic pricing. We find them compatible and their output more comprehensive compared to traditional valuation based on one value perspective. The public participatory softGlS survey delivers information on the perception of urban green spaces, which we use as a criterion for dividing green space categories in a hedonic pricing model. We find that the perception expressed in the survey is generally consistent with the impact on property prices in the case of formal green spaces. However, it is inconsistent when it comes to informal ones: places identified as lacking well-maintained greenery exert a positive influence on property prices, while positively evaluated informal green spaces had no impact at all. We identify the latter as a typical trade-off between different value perspectives: informal green spaces are perceived differently following a monetary and a non-monetary approach.

42	As digital technologies become ubiquitous in many places, scholars of civic engagement, youth and political life, and geographic education have explored the potential of teaching critical and spatial thinking through digital technologies. This paper examines interactive digital mapping as a technology environment for teaching and practicing critical spatial thinking, in relation to civic engagement. From this participatory and dialogic mapping project with teenage girls in Seattle, Washington, we develop a conceptualization of critical spatial thinking that emphasizes how social and spatial processes intertwine to generate societal inequalities and show how this learning informs students' social and spatial civic responses. We show how interactive digital mapping pedagogies offer students an opportunity to develop awareness of what happens in their urban geographies, but also how and what they might do to intervene.	10.1080/14733285.2015.1136736	2016
44	A high level of road traffic noise during the night can alter individuals' wellbeing. The first objective of this paper is to determine whether the groups that are most vulnerable to road traffic noise, namely children under 15 years old and people aged 65 and over, and the groups most likely to experience high levels of nuisance, namely visible minorities and low-income individuals, are affected by environmental inequities with regard to road traffic noise during the night. The second objective is to identify the sectors where the mean level of noise surpasses the 55 dB(A) tolerance threshold established by the World Health Organization. The methodology for estimating the level of nocturnal road traffic noise is based on a combination of elements of the road and urban environments. All of these parameters have been considered in calculating road traffic noise in the most densely inhabited portion of the Island of Montreal. The results of the statistical tests show that the groups selected on the basis of age are not affected by any environmental inequities. However, areas with more low-income individuals and visible minorities are more likely to be characterized by higher levels of road traffic noise when compared with the rest of the population.	10.1111/cag.12281	2016
45	While a number of studies have applied public participation GIS (PPGIS) approaches to the spatial assessment of ecosystem services, few have considered the associations between the spatial distribution of ecosystem services and the context-specific nature of self-reported well-being. In this study, we engage the general public to identify and map a range of ecosystem services that originate in place based, local knowledge and explore the context-dependent nature of subjective well-being. We conducted a PPGIS survey with 219 local residents in a Spanish agroforestry (dehesa) landscapes and analysed the spatial patterns of mapped ecosystem services, their relation to land cover, protected area and common land patterns. In addition, we explored the landscape values contributing to people's wellbeing; and the relationships between ecosystem services in different land covers, landscape values and socio-demographic characteristics. A mosaic of landscape types (i.e., the landscape) provided more ecosystem services (especially cultural and provisioning) to people compared with the individual land system of agroforestry. However, land tenure and public access significantly guided the spatial practices and values of the people beyond the preferred landscape types. The contribution of the landscape to well-being is largely related to values based on interactions among people and the landscape, as tranquillity/relaxation and people-people interactions such as being with family and friends. We discuss the specific contribution of agroforestry landscapes to the provision of ecosystem services and human wellbeing. We conclude that the integration of the applied methods of social-cultural assessment on the one hand links to ecosystem services frameworks but on the other hand represents a more holistic conceptualisation of people's benefits from landscapes.

46	As urbanization gathers pace and climate change increases the number and magnitude of many natural hazards, cities are increasingly becoming hot spots for disasters. Although the role of appropriate urban forms in reducing disaster vulnerability has been recognized for some time, the majority of its potential remains focused on long-term mitigation efforts. In contrast, examination of the relationships with short-term disaster management activities such as response and immediate recovery has not been thoroughly conducted. This paper contributes to this shortfall by analysing a critical type of rapid onset disaster, a near-field tsunami, and the role of urban form in supporting the populations' core response activities of evacuation and sheltering. The Chilean city of Iquique (affected by a severe earthquake and minor tsunami in 2014) is examined using a mixed methods approach that provides the basis for proposed macro-scale and micro-scale changes in its urban form; these modifications, in turn, are assessed with geographic information system (GIS) and agent-based computer models. The results show important existing evacuation vulnerability throughout major areas of the city (as the result of interrelated critical conditions), which nonetheless could be significantly reduced by the changes proposed. Further steps in this iterative process, in turn, could lead to the development of evacuation-based urban design standards capable of being transferred to different tsunami-prone contexts around the world.	10.1177/0265813515597229	2016
47	The emergence of Web 2.0, open source software tools, and geosocial networks, along with associated mobile devices and available government data, is widely considered to have altered the nature and processes of place-based digital participation. Considerable theorizing has been dedicated to the geographic version of Web 2.0, the geospatial Web (Geoweb). To assess the theories, we draw on four years of empirical work across Canada that considers the nature of public participation on the Geoweb. We are driven by the question of how easy or difficult it is to do Geoweb-enabled participation, particularly participation as envisioned by researchers such as Arnstein and planning practitioners. We consider how the Geoweb could transform methods by which citizens and nonprofit organizations communicate with the state on environmental issues that affect their lives. We conduct a meta-analysis of twelve research cases and derive new findings that reach across the cases on how the Geoweb obliges us to redefine and unitize participation. This redefinition reifies existing digital inequalities, blurs distinctions between experts and nonexperts, heterogenizes the state as an actor in the participation process, reassigns participation activities in a participation hierarchy, and distances participation from channels of influence.

48	Recent revelations of dragnet surveillance by governments around the world have brought attention to privacy and surveillance in their many forms. In this article, we outline the technical mechanisms of geosurveillance to synthesize and inform on a constantly moving target. Despite their interconnections and overlap, to simplify and elucidate these geosurveillance mechanisms, we classify them into three parts: geolocation, unique identification, and the surveillance medium. We show that together they constitute a language that we, as subjects, did not choose yet are increasingly forced to negotiate. Moreover, these mechanisms are both numerous and highly complex and are only one component within large ecosystems of geosurveillance, making privacy ever more evasive. Understanding the mechanisms of our own subjection is integral to any prospects for intervention, however. As such, we highlight the Tor network as an example of resistance to geosurveillance that is enabled by acutely understanding the hypertechnical language that otherwise binds us. Indeed, as we emphasize throughout, mechanism matters.	NA	2016
49	Tajikistan like other mountainous nations in Central Asia faces the dual problem of poverty and exposure to multiple natural hazards such as mass wasting, flooding, and prolonged cold. In this case study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 rural Tajik households in order to characterize their vulnerability and adaptation to prolonged winter cold. The household interviews were supplemented with interviews with village leaders, doctors, and school staff. Key interview themes regarding the road network were then compared with GIS road network analysis of the region. Results suggested that the area is highly vulnerable to the impacts of prolonged cold, which could ultimately be made worse through the unsustainable land-use practices, especially for agricultural and biofuel resources. The combination of unreliable sources of income and lower accessibility to markets in winter results in less ability of the residents of these rural villages to mitigate the impacts of prolonged cold. Analysis of the road network using GIS provided additional evidence for the influence of accessibility on vulnerability to prolonged cold.	10.1007/s11069-016-2394-x	2016
50	This paper presents the findings of a study that used an innovative mixed methods community based participatory research approach that included participatory photo  and finally, 4) a breakdown of community control and individual and community vulnerability. The youths' narratives are used to highlight research and practice implications and suggest the need for future youth-engaged, community-partnered intervention research to address the effects of housing abandonment."mapping, which combines photography, youth-led neighborhood tours, and advocacy (n = 10); in-depth interviews with youth (n = 21); and spatial analysis of neighborhood factors using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The focus is on youths' descriptions of the meaning and implications of abandoned housing for their own and their community's well-being. Youth in this study indicated that abandoned properties signify that no one cares about the neighborhood. A youth-authored version of broken windows theory is presented that can be used to better understand the built environment as an indicator of child and neighborhood well-being. This multi-step cycle, reminiscent of broken windows theory, is as follows: 1) unrepaired signs of incivility signal that no one cares; 2) residents withdraw, become more fearful; 3) untended property becomes \\fair game\\" leading to more crime and incivilities	10.1007/s12187-015-9327-1	2016
51	An effort was made to prepare thematic maps of fisheries resources from trawlers along Mumbai coast, Maharashtra using Participatory GIS. Geospatial data on fishing, catch and samples of fish from commercial fishing vessels was collected and processed in Arc GIS 10.2 to develop tools for fishery management and resource conservation of the region. It emerged that the trawlers from Mumbai carried out trawling operations between 20(0)22'50\\N to 18(0)12'20\\"N latitude and 72(0)21'50\\"E to 72(0)52'00\\"E longitude in depth range of 5 to 40 m. Catch percentage varied from 66% to 92% and 70% to 95% by multi-day and single-day trawlers respectively. Discard comprised juveniles of commercial species and adult fishes of low market value. In all, 121 species were caught by multi-day and single-day trawlers."	NA	2016
52	Built environment is an essential component of traffic safety. Using data from the Georgia Department of Transportation from 2000 to 2007, the authors investigated the influence of built environment on pedestrian crashes in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. A network-based kernel density technique was used to locate the hotspots of pedestrian crashes. An environmental audit was then conducted to provide a qualitative assessment of the built environment within each hotspot. Bivariate analysis and negative binomial models were utilized to examine the influence quantitatively after the road was partitioned into short road segments. Results show more pedestrian crashes were likely to occur on segments with less gradient change and with more public transit stops, and be close to census tracts with more public transit users, fewer seniors, and more linguistically isolated households. The findings emphasize the need for more extensive prevention campaigns around the hotspots and consideration of pedestrian safety in future urban and environmental planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

53	This article introduces an interdisciplinary collaboration that brings together sympathetic trends in qualitative geographic visualization (from the perspective of one author who is a geographer) and contemporary generative artistic practices (from the perspective of the other author, who is an artist and theorist)-attempting to represent a diverse array of creative and multi-modal data through generative and participatory digital methods. We present how this convergence expands categories of meaning, allowing us to explore experiential/embodied as well as creative/imaginative engagements with everyday geographies distinct to a digital age. The article mediates on the idea of mapping the imagination and the ways we imagine quotidian spaces, as well as possibilities for new methods for the analysis and representation of spatial and emotional complexity. We particularly explore strategies of integrating multiple technologies and multiple-modes of representation for mapping and re-mapping complexities of social and creative living in order to help provide alternate ways to imagine, represent and engage different forms of embodied and imaginative geographies. This article presents a case study with the artist Andrew Buckles, in Seattle, Washington, correlating representational and participatory digital data including geospatial, temporal, audio, video as well as electroencephalography readings from brainwave sensors.	10.1007/s10708-015-9638-2	2016
54	Children represent a population group that is much neglected in the city planning process. Their perceptions, which are different from those of adults, are usually not incorporated in the design of cities. The aim of this paper is to present a qualitative GIS approach to capture children's perceptions of the urban environment. It gives a detailed insight into why certain perceptions occur and what the associated physical and social qualities are. The approach considers children as active participants and combines quantitative and qualitative methods. Twenty-eight children aged 10-17 were involved in examining the city-centre area of Enschede, the Netherlands. The results show both similarity and heterogeneity in perception (e.g. based on gender and age group) and the emergence of new location-specific qualities (e.g. natural elements, smart technologies, economic functions). It concludes with a discussion on the potential of incorporating this approach in urban planning processes.	10.1080/14733285.2015.1103836	2016
55	Transcribing what is held in one's mind to a tangible map is experiencing a multidisciplinary renewal. Sketch mapping is being utilized to identify a range of community concerns, as well as for more generally revealing otherwise invisible landscapes. Whether the aim is to understand preference, perception, knowledge, or behavior, the result is some form of map. The genesis of this concept is usually attributed to seminal work in the 1960s and 1970s geography, planning, and environmental psychology. However, its resurgence in the past decade has been driven by a confluence of recent methodological and epistemological developments across numerous disciplines surrounding the role of local knowledge in ecological frameworks and how this can be mapped and analyzed with and without geospatial technologies. With growing adoption of sketch mapping well beyond its initial disciplinary niches, it is appropriate to review its evolution in order to inform ongoing and future research.	10.1111/j.1931-0846.2016.12193.x	2016
56	This paper investigates one specific cultural ecosystem service: outdoor recreation. We present a method to map the collective preferences for outdoor recreation and to identify the substitutability among nature sites in the context of the province of Antwerp, Belgium. We propose an indicator of substitutability among nature areas, contrasting unique but poorly substitutable sites (hot spots) with highly substitutable sites (cold spots). Using a combination of survey information, public participation GIS (PPGIS) and kernel density mapping, we produce density surfaces representing the distribution of the collective preferences for outdoor recreation and identify the spatial characteristics of the market (e.g. extent, discontinuities) for outdoor recreation. We also compute Getis-Ord G(i)* spatial statistics to identify local outdoor recreation clusters. In addition, we explore how recreational behaviour affects substitutability. Our results suggest a duality between the social value of outdoor recreation and the level of substitutability among nature sites. Highly substitutable sites tend to be found near areas of higher population density, which are as well highly visited sites. The type of recreational activity - hiking, cycling, dog walking or jogging - appears to substantially modify substitutability patterns among nature sites. We conclude by discussing the methodological implications of this research in the context of stated preference ecosystem service valuation and stress several policy -related implications.

57	Even though global interest in mangrove research has increased in recent years, unveiling their immense ecological and economic roles, very little work has been done to investigate the primary driving factors motivating long-term community-based mangrove restoration and management on local scales. In Ghana, policy makers and coastal management practitioners have recently embraced the concept of community-based and co-management of coastal and marine resources. Community-based and co-management approaches require that key stakeholders, most notably the resource users themselves, play significant roles and responsibilities in the management process. However, there is little evaluation of the process in Ghana to assess the success or otherwise, particularly of the few and long standing examples of community-based approaches in coastal resource management. With special reference to an over two decade old community-based mangrove forestry programme along the Volta estuary of Ghana, this paper provides concepts for examination of the ecological and socioeconomic factors influencing mangrove restoration and management by fishers, fish mongers, farmers and their socioeconomic groupings. Participatory GIS mapping and the use of orthophotos generated for the period 1974-2011 provided additional information on temporal evolution of the extent of mangrove areas restored and managed by local stakeholders. Socioeconomic assessment of mangrove products utility was done through questionnaire interviews. The results indicate that livelihoods and economic benefits are the primary factors that motivate local stakeholders' participation in mangrove restoration and management. Mangroves provisioning services, markets and low livelihoods diversification are major drivers of mangrove resources exploitation. The study has shown that mangroves resources can be sustainably exploited, restored and managed if local customary rules are enforced and institutional arrangements put in place to mediate mangrove exploitation and regeneration rates. Such an approach if well developed, could promote coastal resources conservation with high economic returns for the users. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

58	Visitors' assessments of the negative impact of tourism, on physical and social environment, vary based on the location where the evaluation occurs. Research that focuses on identifying visitors' norms within outdoor recreation settings has not been able to link the geographical location with the corresponding evaluation of unacceptable levels of impact. This study combines a traditional on-site visitor survey with a Public Participation Geographic Information Systems survey to produce spatially explicit information on visitors' acceptance of tourism impacts. Using a web-based participatory survey, visitors were asked to indicate specific locations where they felt the effects of tourism disturbed the quality of their experience in Oulanka National Park. These evaluations were analyzed at multiple scales - destination, specific zones, and sites - to promote more efficient park management. Based on visitor evaluations, we found a collection of hotspots in the park where tourism has already caused unacceptable impacts. Visitors noted that crowding and erosion disturbed their experiences, especially along highly visited trail sections, while littering was considered problematic near wilderness huts. However, participant satisfaction at these sites was not lower than elsewhere in the park. This indicates that the association between negative impacts of tourism and visitor satisfaction is not straightforward, but complex. This study encourages the collection of spatially accurate data on visitors' assessments of the effects of tourism because it has the potential to more efficiently direct park management policies. In addition, spatial techniques provide a new means to monitor the impacts of tourism, acknowledging that visitors' perceptions of acceptability of tourism impacts also vary within tourism destinations, such as parks.	10.1080/14616688.2016.1169313	2016
59	Lack of reliable techniques for large-scale monitoring of disease-transmitting mosquitoes is a major public health challenge, especially where advanced geo-information systems are not regularly applicable. We tested an innovative crowd-sourcing approach, which relies simply on knowledge and experiences of residents to rapidly predict areas where disease-transmitting mosquitoes are most abundant. Guided by community-based resource persons, we mapped boundaries and major physical features in three rural Tanzanian villages. We then selected 60 community members, taught them basic map-reading skills, and offered them gridded maps of their own villages (grid size: 200mx200m) so they could identify locations where they believed mosquitoes were most abundant, by ranking the grids from one (highest density) to five (lowest density). The ranks were interpolated in ArcGIS-10 (ESRI-USA) using inverse distance weighting (IDW) method, and re-classified to depict areas people believed had high, medium and low mosquito densities. Finally, we used odor-baited mosquito traps to compare and verify actual outdoor mosquito densities in the same areas. We repeated this process for 12 months, each time with a different group of 60 residents. All entomological surveys depicted similar geographical stratification of mosquito densities in areas classified by community members as having high, medium and low vector abundance. These similarities were observed when all mosquito species were combined, and also when only malaria vectors were considered. Of the 12,412 mosquitoes caught, 60.9% (7,555) were from areas considered by community members as having high mosquito densities, 28% (3,470) from medium density areas, and 11.2% (1,387) from low density areas. This study provides evidence that we can rely on community knowledge and experiences to identify areas where mosquitoes are most abundant or least abundant, even without entomological surveys. This crowd-sourcing method could be further refined and validated to improve community-based planning of mosquito control operations at low-cost.	10.1371/journal.pone.0156388	2016
61	Considerable amounts of geographical data are still collected not in form of GIS data but just as natural language texts. This paper proposes an approach for the automatic geocoding of itineraries described in natural language. This approach needs as an input a text annotated with part-of-speech and geo-semantic tags. The proposed method is divided into three main steps. First, we build a complete graph where vertices represent locations, and all vertices are connected to each other by undirected edges. We assign a weight to all the edges of the complete graph using a multi-criteria analysis approach. Then we compute a minimum spanning tree to obtain an undirected acyclic graph connecting all vertices. And finally, we transform this graph into a partially directed acyclic graph in order to identify the sequence of waypoints and build an approximation of a plausible footprint of the itinerary described. Additionally, the rationale of the proposed approach has been verified with a set of experiments on a corpus of hiking descriptions.	10.1080/13658816.2015.1108422	2016
62	This paper develops a theoretical and conceptual framework for research on urban geographies of food and dietary health. This framework conceptualizes urban dietary health inequities as produced relationally through multiscalar social, political, economic, and biological processes intersecting in place-specific ways. It synthesizes perspectives from spatial analytical food access research, relational health geographies, political ecologies, and critical geographic information science (GIS). Recognizing the importance of relational, dynamic conceptions of both spatial context and human health, it suggests extending current approaches by integrating critical GIS methodologies for producing alternative spatial representations and political ecology's theorization of urban spaces as produced through the intersection of multiscalar social and ecological processes. Reflecting political ecological and critical GIS perspectives, it also emphasizes that (spatial) knowledge production processes materially impact urban environments and human health.	10.1111/gec3.12268	2016
63	Sketch mapping has been an important data collection technique for geographers since the 1960s. Structured sketch mapping requires participants to draw spatial data onto a base map containing cartographic information, in order to assist with spatial referencing. A concern that base map characteristics may influence sketch map content has been raised repeatedly in the research literature. However little scholarly attention has been paid to systematically testing the effect of base maps. This paper aims to test the effects of base map size and imagery on structured sketch maps of avoidance behaviour in university students. Using an experimental design, 272 sketch maps were compared for differences in: sketch map style; the location of collective avoidance hotspots; the extent of the reported area avoided; the number of reported areas avoided; the intensity of avoidance; and the tortuosity of sketch map features. No significant differences were found between base maps in sketch map style or the size, intensity or number of areas avoided. Provision of larger base maps caused respondents to draw more detailed sketch maps. Collective avoidance hotspots shifted location slightly between base maps, probably due to difficulties interpreting aerial photographs. Sketch map content appears to be remarkably robust to changes in base map. Base maps appear to assist respondents with spatial referencing rather than cueing respondents to report specific features.

64	River flooding is a serious hazard in the UK with interest driven by recent widespread events. This paper reviews different approaches to flood risk management and the borders (physical, conceptual and organisational) that are involved. The paper showcases a multi-method approach to negotiating flood risk management interventions. We address three fundamental issues around flood risk management: differences and similarities between a variety of approaches; how different approaches work across borders between professionals, lay people, organisations and between different planning regimes; and, whether the science evidence base is adequate to support different types of flood risk management. We explore these issues through a case study on the River Tweed using Q methodology, community mapping and focus groups, participatory GIS, and interviews, which enabled co-production of knowledge around possible interventions to manage flooding. Our research demonstrated that excellent networks of practice exist to make decisions about flood risk management in the Scottish-English borders. Physical and organisational borders were continually traversed in practice. There was an overwhelming desire from professional flood managers and local communities for an alternative to simply structural methods of flood management. People were keen to make use of the ability of catchments to store water, even if land needed to be sacrificed to do so. There was no difference in the desire to embrace natural flood management approaches between people with different roles in flood management, expertise, training or based in different locations. Thus conceptual borders were also crossed effectively in practice.	10.1007/s11069-016-2284-2	2016
65	This paper presents innovative ways to relate survey data to GIS maps, thereby making the connection of people and place more accessible for the research community. Based on data from rural areas in the Brazilian Amazon, we describe a successful effort to sample households while linking farm-level data to property boundaries, these boundaries generated from subjects' interpretations of satellite images on a computer screen. The sampling framework is based on legislation requiring farmers to report to a government agency in a four-week period, and the farmers' input allows for a more efficient means of identifying property boundaries as compared to GPS. We show that the resulting sampling is statistically representative. We discuss the potential of this association of institutional design and low-cost methods of data collection to allow for more cost-effective generation of spatial data and of geospatial analysis.	10.1007/s11111-015-0249-0	2016

67	Background: Given the challenges of aging populations, calls have been issued for more sustainable urban re-development and implementation of local solutions to address global environmental and healthy aging issues. However, few studies have considered older adults' daily mobility to better understand how local built and social environments may contribute to healthy aging. Meanwhile, wearable sensors and interactive map-based applications offer novel means for gathering information on people's mobility, levels of physical activity, or social network structure. Combining such data with classical questionnaires on well-being, physical activity, perceived environments and qualitative assessment of experience of places opens new opportunities to assess the complex interplay between individuals and environments. In line with current gaps and novel analytical capabilities, this research proposes an international research agenda to collect and analyse detailed data on daily mobility, social networks and health outcomes among older adults using interactive web-based questionnaires and wearable sensors. Methods/Design: Our study resorts to a battery of innovative data collection methods including use of a novel multisensor device for collection of location and physical activity, interactive map-based questionnaires on regular destinations and social networks, and qualitative assessment of experience of places. This rich data will allow advanced quantitative and qualitative analyses in the aim to disentangle the complex people-environment interactions linking urban local contexts to healthy aging, with a focus on active living, social networks and participation, and well-being. Discussion: This project will generate evidence about what characteristics of urban environments relate to active mobility, social participation, and well-being, three important dimensions of healthy aging. It also sets the basis for an international research agenda on built environment and healthy aging based on a shared and comprehensive data collection protocol.	10.1186/s12877-016-0273-7	2016
68	Wayfinding, or the ability to plan and navigate a course over the landscape, is a subject of investigation in geography, neurophysiology, psychology, urban planning, and landscape design.(1-4) With the prevalence of GPS-assisted navigation systems, or \\wayfinders,\\" computer scientists are also increasingly interested in understanding how people plan their movements and guide others. However, the importance of wayfinding as a process that regulates human mobility has only recently been incorporated into archeological research design.(5,6) Hominin groups were able to disperse widely during the course of prehistory. The scope of these dispersals speaks to the innate navigation abilities of hominins. Their long-term success must have depended on an ability to communicate spatial information effectively. Here, we consider the extent to which some landscapes may have been more conducive to wayfinding than others. We also describe a tool we have created for quantifying landscape legibility (sensu Gollege(2)), a complex and under-explored concept in archeology, with a view to investigating the impact of landscape structure on human wayfinding and thus, patterns of dispersal during prehistory. To this end, we have developed a method for quantifying legibility using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and apply it to a test case in prehistoric Iberia."	10.1002/evan.21484	2016
69	Detailed habitat maps are critical for conservation planning, yet for many coastal habitats only coarse-resolution maps are available. As the logistic and technological constraints of habitat mapping become increasingly tractable, habitat map comparisons are warranted. Here we compare two mapping approaches: local environmental knowledge (LEK) obtained from interviews; and remote sensing analysis (RS) of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (2.0 m pixel) using object-based image analysis. For a coral reef ecosystem, we compare the accuracy of these two approaches for mapping shallow seafloor habitats and contrast their characterization of habitat area and seascape connectivity. We also explore several implications for conservation planning. When evaluated using independent ground verification data, LEK-derived maps achieved a lower overall accuracy than RS-derived maps (LEK: 66%; RS: 76%). A comparison of mapped habitats found low overall agreement between LEK and RS maps. The RS map identified 5.4 times more habitat edges (the border between adjacent habitat classes) and 3.7-6.4 times greater seascape connectivity. Since the spatial arrangement of habitats affects many species (e.g., movement, predation risk), such discrepancies in landscape metrics are important to consider in conservation planning. Our results help identify strengths and weakness of both mapping approaches for conservation planning. Because RS provided a more accurate estimate of habitat distributions, it would be better for conservation planning for species sensitive to fine-spatial scale seascape patterns (e.g., habitat edges), whereas LEK is more cost effective and appropriate for mapping coarse habitat patterns. Goals for maps used in conservation should be identified early in their development.	10.1002/ecs2.1325	2016
70	Rural residents, including elderly, low-income or people with language or physical mobility challenges, may experience transportation disadvantage when land use patterns, built environment and transportation services fail to meet their mobility needs. A technique for identifying transportation-dis-advantaged populations, intended for use by local practitioners and designed with their skills and professional routines in mind, was piloted in five rural counties in North Carolina. Maps showing areas of elevated theoretical risk of transportation disadvantage were constructed by overlaying layers of readily available, Census-based geospatial data, to generate composite maps where increasing intensity of shading denotes populations with multiple risk factors. The maps were used in key informant interviews with local transportation-relevant professionals to access their expert knowledge, and in focus groups with non-expert residents to probe their travel routines and need to access essential goods, services and activities. These multiple data sources supported an iterative process of initial mapping, stakeholder outreach, revised mapping, and continued discussion. Our findings both corroborated some a priori expectations, and yielded unexpected insights into which residents may experience transportation disadvantage and how they respond. The work demonstrates how local knowledge can be used to identify unique or non-spatial components of transportation disadvantage, and underscores the importance of locally specific knowledge to support planning efforts to identify and ultimately to address transportation disadvantage.

71	A large proportion of American Indian reservation lands are owned by non-Indian entities. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a powerful tool for visualising land tenure changes, and public participation GIS (PPGIS) is one approach for using spatial technologies to facilitate the identification and reacquisition of reservation lands by tribes. While some tribes have successfully harnessed GIS for land management and for systematically identifying lands for reacquisition, others struggle to implement land management systems such as GIS for these purposes. This paper situates PPGIS in relation to other forms of participatory action research and outlines our use of a PPGIS framework to engage undergraduate geography students in the mapping of land tenure status on ten rural Minnesota Indian reservations as part of a collaborative partnership with the Indian Land Tenure Foundation (ILTF). A PPGIS framework allowed us to collaboratively define research goals in response to tribal community needs and provided structure for student work with partner reservations to develop and implement tailored mapping and analysis techniques. Two sets of findings are significant. First, the assembly of a standardised set of maps for American Indian reservations in Minnesota provides a tremendous visual and analytical resource for ILTF and individual tribes to pursue land reacquisition within reservation boundaries. Second, from a PPGIS perspective, we found that working with a coordinating or bridging' organisation provided key benefits by enabling education of both the student-faculty partners and the individual tribes. The PPGIS model empowered both partners by allowing tribes to harness a powerful technology to assist in visualising land-based assets and allowing students to contribute to native land reacquisition efforts through application of their GIS skills. This mapping helps facilitate economic and cultural viability in tribal communities by providing an important visual catalogue of existing land-based assets, in support of future land acquisition and economic development planning.	10.1111/1745-5871.12167	2016

80	Context An ecosystem service approach for land-use or conservation decisions normally uses economic or biophysical assessments for valuating nature's services. In contrast, even though ecosystem services are required for human well-being, the actual use of services by differing stakeholder groups are rarely considered in typical ecosystem service assessments, especially the more intangible, cultural ecosystem services. Objectives The aim of this research was to quantify different uses for 15 cultural and provisioning ecosystem service indicators across seven stakeholder groups in a watershed proposed with large hydroelectric dam development. Methods We used a large-scale survey to quantify use and frequency of use for ecosystem services. Results We demonstrate that different stakeholder groups use ecosystem services differently, both in terms of specific ecosystem service indicators, as well as for frequency of ecosystem service use. Across all stakeholder groups, specific cultural ecosystem services were consistently more important to participants when compared to provisioning ecosystem services, especially aesthetic/scenic values. Conclusions This work is of global importance as it highlights the importance of considering cultural ecosystem services (e.g. aesthetic/scenic, sense-of-place values) along with multiple stakeholder groups to identify the trade-offs and synergies during decision-making processes for land-use or conservation initiatives.	10.1007/s10980-015-0260-y	2016
73	Collaborative online research offers opportunities and constraints for geographers. This article critically appraises a collaborative research process that we used to illuminate spatial and political dynamics of feminism contained within the online group 'Destroy the Joint' (DTJ). A mostly Australian initiative of over 74000 Facebook members, DTJ aims to end sexism and misogyny in multiple ways. It operates as a meeting place, discussion forum, and umbrella organisation for numerous micro-campaigns that change in response to broader social, cultural and political contexts, and occur in online and offline spaces. We formed a collaborative research agreement with the moderators of DTJ to reflect on its work, asking participants to put themselves on a map and complete a survey. Participatory GIS and survey-based research operated in the real and the more-than-real spaces that contain paradoxical possibilities. We use the term more-than-real to highlight the excesses of digital spaces: the affect that social media generates, and is generated by, characterises the more-than-real, where extremes in productive and corrosive relations can permeate. Survey results showed diverse appreciations of DTJ's multiple activist tactics (across seemingly 'superficial' and 'meaningful' interventions), and creative ideas for future campaigns. Mapping revealed both dispersed networks and urban activist concentrations. Nevertheless, after an initial peak of interest and enthusiasm for reflecting on DTJ, the reporting back of research findings to DTJ followers did not garner significant interest. This article tracks that collaborative research trajectory. Intentions to build a hybrid research collective were not realised because of how the more-than-real affords possibilities and limitations. The politics of 'giving-back' within the more-than-real are critically engaged with in this appraisal of an experimental online collaboration.	10.1080/00049182.2016.1138842	2016
74	Public participatory geographic information systems (PPGIS) have been advanced as a means to include those who have been traditionally excluded from numerous place-specific governance activities, including planning and policymaking and as a way to resolve some of the long-standing tensions between critical traditions in human geography and the ever-expanding field of GIS. Despite the rapid adoption of participatory GIS by academics, government officials, and planning professionals, there are few guidelines of best practices for PPGIS researchers and practitioners to draw on and little effort has been made to understand how and in what ways PPGIS efforts are (or perhaps are not) effective. This article contributes to these important debates by evaluating the geography of participation in a recent participatory planning project undertaken in Muncie, Indiana. Using the mapped information that was generated from a series of public meetings, we have identified the presence of significant spatial bias in the process of participation that affected the resulting plan. This was an unexamined source of bias during this process and an example of why any emerging conversations about the best practices for PPGIS must include a consideration of the geography of participation. Los sistemas de informacion geografica participativos publicos (PPSIG) han sido desarrollados como el medio para incluir a quienes tradicionalmente han estado excluidos de numerosas actividades gubernativas de especificidad lugarena, incluyendo la planificacion y la generacion de politicas, y como una manera de resolver algunas de las tensiones de vieja data entre las tradiciones criticas de la geografia humana y el campo de los SIG en permanente expansion. A pesar de la rapida adopcion de los SIG participativos por academicos, agentes del gobierno y profesionales de la planificacion, hay muy pocas guias sobre mejores practicas para ayudar a investigadores y practicantes de PPSIG, y escaso ha sido el intento para entender como y de que manera los esfuerzos de los PPSIG son efectivos (o quizas no). Este articulo contribuye a estos importantes debates evaluando la geografia de la participacion en un reciente proyecto participativo de planificacion emprendido en Muncie, Indiana. Usando la informacion cartografica generada a partir de una serie de reuniones publicas, hemos identificado la presencia de sesgos espaciales significativos en el proceso de participacion, que afectaron el plan resultante. Esta fue una fuente de sesgo no examinada durante el proceso y un ejemplo de por que cualquier conversacion que surja acerca de las mejores practicas de los PPSIG debe tomar en cuenta a la geografia de la participacion.	10.1080/00330124.2015.1054750	2016
75	OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an online public access database that allows for the collaborative collection of local geographic information. We employ this mapping technology to discuss a new social theory of poverty that moves away from income poverty to an economy that directly produces individuals' basic needs. Focusing on urban farming in Philadelphia as an example, we use OSM to support the argument that money, land, labor, and capital do not limit food production in the city. OSM is a type of commons that allows community members to depict features of interest to them that might otherwise be underrepresented in official or commercially produced maps such as Google Maps. Using the concept of facilitated volunteered geographic information (VGI) we developed an open framework for combining residents' local knowledge of food resources with expert guidance in data input. We believe this helps overcome problems with ad hoc data submission efforts to which collaborative online projects are susceptible. The program for tagging food resources in OSM was deployed in a public map-a-thon event we organized in Philadelphia, bringing together technical experts and food enthusiasts. To share the results, we present the Philly Fresh Food Map as an interactive online Web map that can be used and updated by the public. ??????

El OpenStreetMap (OSM) es una base de datos en red de acceso publico que permite la recoleccion colaborativa de informacion geografica local. Empleamos esta tecnologia cartografica para discutir una nueva teoria social de la pobreza, que se desplaza desde aquella que define la pobreza por el ingreso, hacia una economia que directamente produce las necesidades basicas del individuo. Si nos enfocamos en la agricultura urbana de Filadelfia, como ejemplo, usamos el OSM en apoyo del argumento de que el dinero, la tierra, el trabajo y el capital no limitan la produccion de alimentos en la ciudad. El OSM es un tipo de comunales que permite a los miembros de la comunidad representar rasgos de su interes que de otro modo podrian quedarian mal representados en los mapas oficiales o en los producidos comercialmente, tales como los Mapas Google. Utilizando el concepto de informacion geografica voluntariamente facilitada (VGI) desarrollamos un marco abierto para combinar el conocimiento local de recursos del alimento de los residentes con la guia de un experto en entrada de datos. Creemos que esto ayuda a vencer los problemas relacionados con los esfuerzos de remitir datos ad hoc a los cuales los proyectos urbanos colaborativos son susceptibles. El programa para etiquetar los recursos alimentarios en OSM fue desplegado en un evento publico de mapaton que nosotros organizamos en Filadelfia, en el que reunimos a expertos tecnicos y a entusiastas de los alimentos. Para compartir resultados, presentamos el Mapa Philly Fresh Food, a titulo de mapa Web interactivo en red que puede ser usado y actualizado por el publico.	10.1080/00330124.2015.1065547	2016

77	Background: Emergency departments (ED) recognize crowding and handover from prehospital to in-hospital settings to be major challenges. Prehospital Geographical Information Systems (GIS) may be a promising tool to address such issues. In this study, the use of prehospital GIS data was implemented in an ED in order to investigate its effect on 1) wait time and unprepared activations of Trauma Teams (TT) and Medical Emergency Teams (MET) and 2) nurses' perceptions regarding patient reception, workflow and resource utilization. Methods: Intervention: From May 1st 2014 to October 31th 2014, GIS data was displayed in the ED. Data included real-time estimated time of arrival, distance to ED, dispatch criteria, patient data and ambulance contact information. Data was used by coordinating nurses for time activation of TT and MET involved in the initial treatment of severely-injured or critically-ill patients. In addition, it was used as a logistics tool for handling all other patients transported by ambulance to the ED. Study design: The study followed a mixed-methods design, consisting of a quantitative study (before and after intervention) and a qualitative study (survey and interviews). Participants: Participants included all patients received by TT or MET and coordinating nurses in the ED. Results: 1.) Quantitative: 599 patients were included. The median wait time for TT and MET was 5 min both before and after the GIS intervention, showing no difference (p = 0.18). A significant reduction in the subgroup of waits > 10 min was found (p < 0.05). No difference was found in unprepared TT and MET activations. 2.) Qualitative: Nurses perceived GIS data as a tool to optimize resource utilization and quality of all patients' reception, critically or non-critically ill. No substantial disadvantages were reported. Discussion: The contradiction of measured median wait time and nurses perceived improved timing of team activation may result from having both RT-ETA and supplemental patient information not only for seriously-injured or critically-ill patients received by the TT and MET, but for all patients transported by ambulance. The reduction in waits > 10 minutes may have contributed to the overall perception of reduced wait time, as avoidance of long waits is clinically more important than reduction in the median wait time. Conclusion: A comparison of the use of prehospital GIS data in the ED with the control period showed no effect on median wait time for TT and MET, however, the number of waits of > 10 min was reduced. On the other hand, nurses perceived implementation of GIS data as improving workflow, resource utilization and quality of all patients' reception, critically as well as non-critically ill. There were no substantial disadvantages to the GIS application.	10.1186/s13049-016-0232-5	2016
78	Maps and mapping are integral elements in the methodological toolbox used by children's geographers studying children's environmental relationships. The advent of new technologies, particularly computer-mapping software, offers immense potential for enhancing understanding and representation of children's everyday spatial relationships. Computerised mapping tools appeal to children and offer new and exciting applications where children can directly demonstrate their ecological knowledge providing evidence that can be used to challenge commonly held notions that city children are disconnected from nature. This paper explores the development of a computer-mapping interface, combining aerial photos and GIS. We argue that the appropriate application of child-oriented methods allows children to demonstrate carefully, meaningfully and effectively their knowledge of nature as it occurs at the micro-scale in their neighbourhoods and in their lives.	10.1080/14733285.2015.1126552	2016
79	The unique Hyrcanian (Caspian) forests of northern Iran provide vital ecosystem services for local and global communities. We assess the status and trends of key ecosystem services in this region where native forest conversion has accelerated to make way for housing and farm development. This is a mountainous forested area that is valuable for both conservation and multiple human uses including recreation and farming. It contains globally significant natural habitats for in situ conservation of biological diversity. A rapid, qualitative, and participatory approach was used including interviews with local households and experts in combination with assessment of land use/cover remote sensing data to identify and map priority ecosystem services in the Geographic Information System (GIS). Based on the interests of the beneficiaries, eight priority services (food production, water supply, raw materials, soil conservation, water regulation, climate regulation, biodiversity, and recreation) were identified and mapped. The results indicate the current typical spatial distribution of the provided services based on structural characteristics of the study landscape and their changing trends through a comparison of past, present and future land use, and land cover. Although food production and recreation have greatly increased in recent decades, the other services, in particular timber production, biodiversity, and water purification and supply are being gradually lost. The results of this study and of others elsewhere should raise awareness of ecosystem service status and trends and the value of examining these since they provide much of the information to inform natural resources policy and decision making. The declines in supply of key ecosystem services both within and outside the protected area are creating conflicts within communities as well as impacting on the integrity of the area and careful planning and conservation is required to provide win-win opportunities.	10.3390/f7030051	2016
81	Objective: Analyzing mortality rates and the reasons for these in Turkey's urban allocations using geographic information systems (GISs) is a new research area. While planning health services, knowing the mortality rates and reasons according to age and residential area are a big source of information for health planners and people who provide health services. The aim of this research is to analyze the deaths of children under the age of 5 years in big cities depending on a socioeconomic range using GIS. Further, this should make it possible to determine geographically risky places. Materials and Methods: The deaths of children under the age of 5 years that occurred between 2005 and 2009 were analyzed. Date from the Turkish Statistical Institute (Turk Stat) concerning population and age-specified deaths, Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMM) cemetery directorate death records, and the Ministry of Finance land unit prices (to determine the socioeconomic level of the districts) were used as data resources. The Z value of each year's death rate, depending on the districts age ranges and average of all years' Z values, was calculated and is shown on the map. Results: While the under-5 mortality rate was 19.37 per 1000 in 2005, it was 14.31 per 1000 in 2009. Deaths of children under the age of 5 years took place particularly in Istanbul on the European side (in districts where the land value is low). Conclusion: Priority should be given to health promotion programs in areas with a low socioeconomic level in particular where premature death rates are observed to be more common.	10.5152/etd.2016.0044	2016

83	Stakeholders are presumed to represent different interests for marine and coastal areas with the potential to influence marine protected area planning and management. We implemented a public participation GIS (PPGIS) system in the remote Kimberley region of Australia to identify the spatial values and preferences for marine and coastal areas. We assessed similarities and differences in PPGIS participants (N = 578) using three operational definitions for \\stakeholder\\" based on: (1) self-identified group, (2) self-identified future interests in the region, and (3) participant value orientation that reflects a preferred trade-off between environmental and economic outcomes. We found moderate levels of association between alternative stakeholder classifications that were logically related to general and place specific participatory mapping behavior in the study region. We then analyzed how stakeholder classifications influence specific management preferences for proposed marine protected areas (MPAs) in the study region. Conservation-related values and preferences dominated the mapped results in all proposed marine reserves, the likely result of volunteer sampling bias by conservation stakeholder interests participating in the study. However, we suggest these results may also reflect the highly politicized process of marine conservation planning in the Kimberley where conservation efforts have recently emerged and galvanized to oppose a major offshore gas development and associated land-based infrastructure. Consistent with other participatory mapping studies, our results indicate that the chosen operational definition for stakeholder group such as group identity versus interests can influence participatory mapping outcomes, with implications for MPA designation and management. Future research is needed to better understand the strengths and limitations of participatory mapping that is framed in stakeholder perspectives, especially when sampling relies heavily on volunteer recruitment and participation methods that appear predisposed to participatory bias. In parallel, practical efforts to ensure that social research efforts such as this are included in MPA planning must remain of the highest priority for scientists and managers alike.

84	Qualitative GIS is a relatively new methodological approach for analyzing and visualizing qualitative data within a geographic context. Qualitative data can take many forms, including interviews, documents, photographs, and audio and video clips. Content analysis for example, is an effective qualitative method for analyzing text-based data. We argue that basic concepts, (i.e. how to store data, data requirements, visualization techniques, and modes of analysis) within qualitative GIS have not been adequately defined, rendering difficult the replication of work performed and hindering the development of incremental knowledge in the field. Database management systems provide a means for storing, managing, and analyzing qualitative GIS data. A standardized and well-designed open source database system provides a mechanism for qualitative GIS projects, ensuring consistency and project replication. Qualitative GIS data stored in a database allows for additional visualization options, such as geographic word clouds. To demonstrate the concepts we performed content analysis on Master Transportation Plans from Calgary and Montreal using SpatiaLite, an open source database system. We developed Structured Query Language (SQL) queries to generate and populate groups and theme tables within the SpatiaLite database. We present our database design and queries in the hopes that they will help others conducting qualitative GIS research.	10.1111/tgis.12163	2016
85	Computer programming is not commonly taught to geographers as a part of geographic information system (GIS) courses, but the advent of NeoGeography, big data and open GIS means that programming skills are becoming more important. To encourage the teaching of programming to geographers, this paper outlines a course based around a series of laboratories that aims to provide an introduction to programming. Methods for teaching and assessment are recommended. These laboratories use core spatial concepts that are relevant for all areas of geographic study, and use an open source Python approach that has wider logistical and pedagogical benefits.	10.1080/03098265.2015.1086981	2016
86	A question asked at the first national conference on the educational applications of geographical information systems (GIS) in Washington 1994, namely what learning does GIS allow that other ways do not and whether teaching GIS at school level is worth the time and effort required to implement it, remains largely unanswered. Literature searches suggest that little has been done to investigate the effectiveness of GIS in education since this question was raised. In investigating what learning using GIS allows that other ways do not, this study tested whether using GIS as a teaching and learning strategy enabled the promotion of learners spatial cognition and spatial perspective taking abilities better than traditional methods such as using atlases, rulers and calculators do. Four secondary Geography teachers in four Port Elizabeth schools volunteered to take part in the experimental aspects of this study. Empirical data on the development of spatial cognition and spatial perspective taking were generated via their grade 11 Geography learners. Experimental and comparison groups of learners wrote three different types of pre- and post-tests where the experimental groups worked on GIS software with geo-spatial data while the comparison groups used traditional methods. The empirical data generated by the learners revealed that GIS software and geo-spatial data do statistically significantly promote better spatial cognition and spatial perspective taking than traditional methods do.	10.1080/03736245.2014.977815	2016
102	This paper builds on the designation of networked spatial information technologies (both hardware/software objects and information artifacts) as spatial media' to advance media as an epistemology for engaging these presences as both channels for content and as cultural apparatuses. Doing so directly asserts their materiality as coincident with (new) media techno-cultural productions. This allows for a theory of mediation that belies narratives of virtual'-real' spatial hybrids by instead understanding spatiality (as the nexus of material socio-spatio-technical relations) as always-already mediated - i.e. as the ontogenetic effects of the contingent, necessarily incomplete comings-together of technical presences, persons, and space/place.	10.1177/0309132514558443	2015
87	An important challenge threatening agriculture in Africa is the difficulty in collecting timely data on disease spread and effectiveness of on-farm control methods. This study served as a case study for assessing the viability of a participatory GIS (Geographic Information System) to enable a plant diagnostics network with fieldworkers. The use of mobile phone applications and a centralized database were integrated to provide a blueprint for how a range of agriculture-focused field organizations can collect data, explain events, predict outcomes and adapt and refine strategies with more accurate, cost-efficient and timely information. Over the course of 2 months, 38 Community Knowledge Workers (CKWs) using mobile phones, MTN Mobile Internet and GPS devices collected 3018 surveys documenting the presence/absence of three banana diseases: Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW), Fusarium Wilt (FW) and Banana Bunchy Top disease (BBTD) in Bushenyi and Mbale districts in Uganda. Costs were saved by only mobilizing CKWs who then trained the communities on methods of banana disease detection, preventative measures and disease control procedures; only when doubts over identification or control occurred did the IITA and NARO technical team then prioritize visits. Although the CKWs provided an efficient and cost-effective information channel that can be leveraged to integrate the efforts of scientists with the needs of rural communities, there were significant gaps in prior farmer knowledge on the three targeted diseases, including how to identify or control them, despite extensive awareness campaigns preceding this initiative. Factsheets used for reference following training greatly improved CKW prior knowledge of disease recognition and control methods; hence, 90% of the surveys conducted during the second month met the data quality standards based on survey completeness, GPS accuracy and quality of symptomatic plant photos. There was significant and consistent demand by farmers for CKW services throughout the pilot period. In-depth training and continuous support of CKWs is thus essential. The technology infrastructure is scalable, and further integration of technology components promises a customizable web-based tool for data collection, GIS analysis, information dissemination and management of agriculture extension operations.	10.1080/07060661.2016.1230149	2016
88	According to the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), federal action to manipulate habitat for species conservation requires an environmental impact statement, which should integrate natural, physical, economic, and social sciences in planning and decision making. Nonetheless, most impact assessments focus disproportionately on physical or ecological impacts rather than integrating ecological and socioeconomic components. We developed a participatory social-ecological impact assessment (SEIA) that addresses the requirements of NEPA and integrates social and ecological concepts for impact assessments. We cooperated with the Bureau of Land Management in Idaho, USA on a project designed to restore habitat for the Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). We employed questionnaires, workshop dialogue, and participatory mapping exercises with stakeholders to identify potential environmental changes and subsequent impacts expected to result from the removal of western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis). Via questionnaires and workshop dialogue, stakeholders identified 46 environmental changes and associated positive or negative impacts to people and communities in Owyhee County, Idaho. Results of the participatory mapping exercises showed that the spatial distribution of social, economic, and ecological values throughout Owyhee County are highly associated with the two main watersheds, wilderness areas, and the historic town of Silver City. Altogether, the SEIA process revealed that perceptions of project scale varied among participants, highlighting the need for specificity about spatial and temporal scales. Overall, the SEIA generated substantial information concerning potential impacts associated with habitat treatments for Greater Sage-Grouse. The SEIA is transferable to other land management and conservation contexts because it supports holistic understanding and framing of connections between humans and ecosystems. By applying this SEIA framework, land managers and affected people have an opportunity to fulfill NEPA requirements and develop more comprehensive management plans that better reflect the linkages of social-ecological systems.	10.5751/ES-08569-210309	2016
89	GIScience research has enhanced citizen engagement through advancements in web-based geospatial techniques and qualitative GIS methodologies, which provide opportunities for new forms of knowledge production. This paper draws on two interrelated approaches to demonstrate the ways qualitative GIS and Web 2.0 can provide nuanced analysis and foster collaborations to advance, in particular, food justice goals, which include developing equity in access to quality nutritious foods. First, the authors create a multicriteria food environment index utilizing GIS-based multicriteria modeling to represent food environments as constituted by multiple food sources and access dimensions. This enables visualization of food environment quality and indicates that food environment quality varies within a single neighborhood. Second, they utilize web GIS technologies to capture and visualize volunteered geographic information about urban food environments, demonstrating the importance of citizen perspectives to developing more nuanced understandings of these environments.	10.4018/IJAGR.2016010102	2016
90	The Internet provides a new source of information and a new discussion platform for public participation in planning processes. As geographic information systems (GIS) are an essential part of planning practice, equal access to public participation GIS (PPGIS) is crucial for successful stakeholder collaboration. Unfortunately, people with restricted access to computers, limited Internet skills, and poor map literacy could face potential exclusion. Although the older adults' age groups show the strongest growth among Internet users, their general Internet skills remain limited compared to those of younger age groups. Furthermore, little previous research has been conducted on older adults' usage of PPGIS, as current studies focus mainly on older adults' use of the Internet in general or (passive) web maps in particular; PPGIS usability studies generally target a wider audience. In this qualitative and descriptive study, we examine older adults' experience with a PPGIS survey and implement the findings into a final research survey design. The findings support previous results from other Internet or web map usability studies with older adults while, in addition, displaying similarities to the outcomes of general PPGIS usability studies, especially regarding cognitive abilities. Studying older adults draws attention to a vulnerable but growing Internet user group. As other age groups face similar challenges, we suggest that using older adults as a 'test group' for PPGIS usability could help improve the experience for the wider public.	10.1080/13658816.2016.1170837	2016
91	Current public participation methods are laborious, reach few participants and are ineffective at gathering usable information for planning. This situation leads often to mistrust and dissatisfaction in the process and outcome. This article identifies the critical conditions for meaningful use of public participation GIS (PPGIS) tools to support the making of master plan in Helsinki. With PPGIS tools, residents' insight of their living environment can be reached and utilized along the planning process. The results are divided to conceptual and empirical points. Whereas the conceptual points emphasize better understanding of the locus of the PPGIS tools in planning process, the empirical findings reveal new ways to study how residents' perceptions align with the plan proposal. Though new tools, data and analysis can support representativeness, independence, early involvement, influence and transparency, planners and residents need more understanding of the benefits of these tools. The study indicates that though planners found the collected data and the analysis valuable, they still lacked the skills and institutional motivation to use the data effectively. The results point out that when PPGIS tools can be integrated to the mainstream planning practices, the tools have the ability to evolve to a more comprehensive participatory planning support system.	10.1080/02697459.2015.1104203	2016
92	The emerging ubiquity of geospatial information is providing an unprecedented opportunity to apply Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-based multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to a broad spectrum of use cases. Volunteered geographic information, open GIS software, geoservice-based tools, cloud-based virtualized platforms, and worldwide collaboration of both domain experts and general users have greatly increased the quantity and accessibility of geospatially referenced data resources. Currently, there is a lack of GIS-based MCDA tools that integrate this decision-driven process within a widely accessible, robust geoframework environment, designed for user-friendly interaction. In this contribution, we present a conceptual workflow and proof-of-concept software application, Geocentric Environment for Analysis and Reasoning (GEAR), which provides a viable transition path to enhance geospatial MCDA in the age of open GIS. We propose a Web-based platform that leverages open-source geotechnologies to incorporate a wide variety of geospatial data formats in a common solution space to allow for spatially enhanced and time-relevant decision analysis. Through the proposed workflow, a user can ingest and modify heterogeneous data formats, exploit temporally tagged data sources, create multicriteria decision analysis models, and visualize the results in an iterative and collaborative workspace. A sample case study applied to disaster relief is used to demonstrate the prototype and workflow. This proof-of-concept Web-based application provides a notional pathway of how to connect open-source data to open-source analysis through a geospatially enabled MCDA workflow that could be virtually accessible to many levels of decision makers from individuals to entire organizations.	10.1080/13658816.2016.1155214	2016
93	Bike sharing can play a role in providing access to transit stations and then to final destinations, but early implementation of these systems in North America has been opportunistic rather than strategic. This study evaluates local intermodal plan goals using trip data and associated infrastructure such as transit stops and bike share station locations in Austin, Texas, and Chicago, Illinois. Bike sharing use data from both cities suggest a weak relationship with existing rail stations that could be strengthened through collaborative, intermodal planning. The study suggests a planning framework and example language that could be tailored to help address the linkage between bike sharing and transit. Rather than an exhaustive study of the practice, this study provides evidence from these two cities that identify opportunities to improve intermodal planning. Cities that are planning or expanding a bike sharing system should consider carefully how to leverage this mode with existing modes of transport. Regardless of a city's status in implementing a bike sharing system, planners can leverage information on existing transport systems for planning at regional and local levels.	NA	2016
94	Scientists often turn to farmers to understand soil management. This process reveals differences and overlaps between local and scientific soil knowledge but rarely considers women and gender issues. This paper examines men's and women's local knowledge of soils in upland, smallholder farms in two villages in Mindanao, the Philippines, using focus group discussions, semi-structured household interviews, field visits, GIS and soil testing. Farmers' field areas were calculated and delineated based on their perceptions of the different types of soils on their land. Men and women chose the same plots for what they considered their best soil but differed on what they felt were their worst. The fertility of the soils that women considered to be the best and worst was not significantly different from that of the men's respective choices. There was a difference in fertility, however, between the best and worst soils regardless of gender. Although soil fertility analyses showed that the women's chosen soils were similar to men's, analyses of qualitative data showed that their knowledge of soils was different and was based in part on a gendered division of labour. A multidisciplinary approach helped bridge the gap between sociocultural and physical research.	10.1111/sjtg.12134	2016
95	Previous studies have reported multifaceted, controversial social outcomes of densely built urban settings. Social sustainability of urban environments have rarely been studied in a context-sensitive manner, identifying the specific ways urban structural characteristics contribute to the behavioural, experiential and well-being outcomes. In this study, an online public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) methodology allowed the place-based study of urban and suburban contexts in the metropolitan region of Helsinki, Finland. Respondents (N=3119) located their meaningful places and reported the experiential and well-being outcomes. GIS-based measures of urban structures were calculated within a 500m buffer around their homes. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the contextual variation and the mediational role accessibility and perceived environmental quality play in linking urban structural characteristics with well-being outcomes. Our findings indicated that although increasing urban density was associated with shorter distances to everyday services in both urban and suburban settings, the experiential and well-being outcomes varied. In the urban context, easy access to services contributed to higher perceived environmental quality and positive well-being outcomes, whereas in the suburban setting, the closeness of services decreased the experiential and well-being outcomes. Perceived environmental quality was strongly associated with well-being in both contexts. We concluded that densely built urban neighborhoods can also support social sustainability, but the processes vary between suburban and urban settings. A challenge remains for urban planners on how to improve accessibility and related positive experiential outcomes in suburban contexts.	10.1177/0265813515600121	2016
96	Coastal areas provide a wealth of resources and represent the most developed spaces worldwide. As pressures on these resources increase, managers and policymakers require understanding that facilitates comprehensive valuation of ecosystem services, including social-ecological dynamics and the coupling of social and natural systems. Adoption of ecosystem management approaches has created a need for increased knowledge of social systems commensurate to baseline ecological understanding; that is, managers benefit from integrating stakeholder values into decision-making processes. This study, using the Delphi technique, elicited knowledge and opinions from international coastal experts regarding relevant social values of ecosystem services, facilitating integration of multiple perspectives into an informed consensus typology of 16 social values. Agencies across the board see inclusive evaluation of ecosystem services, including social values, as critical to robust decision making regarding relevant resources. The next step for research findings is application of the typology in resource assessment initiatives within research and practice-based efforts.	10.1080/08941920.2015.1020580	2015
97	The neighborhood context affects social capital, yet scholars do not adequately account for the dynamic nature of the social spaces people occupy in measuring social capital. Research has focused on neighborhood effects as though the neighborhood space is fixed across all inhabitants without regard for the ways individuals define their neighborhoods considering their own spatial location and social interactions. Using a neighborhood-level social capital measure, we examine the relationship between cognitive neighborhood boundaries and social capital in residents (N = 135) of two public housing communities in a Southern urban city. As collective efficacy (bonding social capital) increased so too did the predicted size of one's cognitive neighborhood. GIS maps demonstrated that participant boundaries included areas of commerce and services necessary to build and maintain social capital. Larger cognitive neighborhoods suggest one may interact with a wider array of people to achieve instrumental and expressive returns despite the high-poverty neighborhood context.	10.1111/cico.12133	2015
98	Prior research has examined the relationship between physical landscapes and ecosystem services, but the distribution of ecosystem services by land tenure and protected areas is less developed. We analyze the spatial distribution of participatory mapped ecosystem values, as indicators of ecosystem services, to determine their relationship with land tenure in southern Norway, a region characterized by private, village, and state commons lands overlaid with designated protected areas managed by local governments. We found land tenure to be a significantly stronger predictor of the distribution of ecosystem values and land use preferences than protected area status. Protected area designations layered on older land tenures exert relatively little influence on how Norwegians perceive ecosystem values and land use preferences. The exception is a few iconic parks located on state commons where participants mapped a higher proportion of biological diversity and undisturbed, natural qualities. Hunting and fishing opportunities were especially important in village commons, whereas social interactions, gathering, and cultural identity clustered near settlements on private lands. The cultural ecosystem values of recreation and scenery were most frequently identified, but were unrelated to both land tenure and protected areas. Cabins, tourism development, and snowmobile use were important land uses to regional residents and most controversial in the commons and protected areas, but the overall potential for land use conflict appears highest on private land. Participants mapped preferences to increase predator control across all tenures reflecting the strong interest in large game hunting and livestock grazing in the region. Overlapping tenures that were in place before the designation of protected areas are important for understanding conservation effectiveness and the potential for land use conflict.

99	Geographers of technology illustrate software code's contexts, effects, and agencies as they shape urban space and everyday life, but the consequences of code for nature remain understudied. Political ecologists have critiqued remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based conservation projects, but have not engaged more broadly with the role of software in the contested production, circulation, and application of ecological knowledge. Yet, around the world, data analytics firms and conservation nonprofits argue for optimizing environmental management through faster and bigger data collection and new techniques of data manipulation and visualization. I present a case study from the US state of Oregon, illustrating how conservationists and environmental regulators employ computer programming to plan markets in which entrepreneurs restore stream and wetland ecosystem services to earn offset credits. In these markets, code-executed algorithms constituting spreadsheets, web maps, and GIS utilities generate, relate, and make sense of the data that define credit commodities. I argue that code tends toward three effects: producing a landscape defined by wetlands' modeled value, performing social relations associated with nature's neoliberalization and financialization, and legitimating these moves. Although emphasis on the performativity of code and other technological objects is warranted, the contexts in which these are authored, deployed, and evaluated should remain central to understanding environmental governance. This is to caution against seeing technology as reducing nature and society to state or capitalist rationalities and to hesitate to differentiate prima facie code's work on space and on nature. I call for bridging political ecology and geographies of technology in ways that can explain how code is generative of environmental knowledge, change, and conflict.	10.1177/0308518X15616631	2015
100	Assuring equal accessibility to public outdoor and recreation services is important because of the potential health and social welfare implications. The focus has primarily been on parks and other green spaces but should be expanded to include also the aquatic environments and the numerous recreational opportunities they have to offer. As the accessibility standards and approaches on ensuring equal accessibility to green spaces are often based on purely spatial measurements, this research examined the equality of accessibility of aquatic environments by combining spatio-temporal dimensions of accessibility with person-based measures. Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) method used in the study provided multifaceted knowledge on the person-based accessibility patterns related to aquatic environments in Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. This paper demonstrates how an advanced GIS-based analysis combining both objective and subjective measurements of accessibility can result in more detailed and even contradictory outcomes compared to traditional spatial measures. The results indicate that a common presumption of a nearest service available made in studies on accessibility and environmental justice may have notable impacts on results or even return unfounded interpretations. Results also indicate that there are significant (p < 0.05) differences in accessibility in the study region related to income status and car ownership. We conclude that PPGIS approaches can provide valuable information to accessibility research, studies on environmental justice and provide additional approaches for the planning and management officials of public recreation and outdoor services.

101	The neighbourhood environment may enable active aging by allowing the integration of walking into an older adult's daily routine. This study explores the relationship between the neighbourhood built environment and walking among a small group of older adults in a large suburban municipality in Canada. In-depth interviews using a photo-voice approach revealed that the participants walked largely to accumulated physical activity. Older adults who lived in either conventional residential or condominium neighbourhoods discussed poor traffic conditions and lack of benches/trees/places as barriers, and proximity to parks and access to shops as enablers to walking. Poor sidewalk quality, absence of street lights and personal safety concerns were major barriers to walking only for those living in suburban residential neighbourhoods. Our results indicate that high quality- and safe walking infrastructure may facilitate walking for physical activity among older adults living in the suburban communities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

103	Spatially-explicit participatory planning is a relatively new approach for managing visitors to protected areas. In this study we used public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) mapping and global positioning system (GPS) tracking to monitor mountain bikers frequenting national parks for tourism and recreation in Northern Sydney, Australia. PPGIS was implemented using both an internet application and with hardcopy maps in the field. Our research addressed two fundamental questions for park planning: (1) What is the spatial distribution of visitor activities and location-specific reasons for riding; and (2) What location-specific actions are needed to improve riding experiences? The spatial distributions of riding activities generated in PPGIS showed strong correlation with the GPS tracking results, with riding locations being related to the reasons for track selection. Riders proposed a broad range of management actions to improve riding experiences. PPGIS mapping provides a cost-effective approach to facilitate spatial decision making, allowing park agencies to prioritise future visitor management actions. We discuss the strengths and limitations of these research methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	10.1016/j.tourman.2015.05.003	2015
104	Community is an ambiguous concept, and the meanings of community as a subject of study have received a great deal of attention across various disciplines. This paper discusses how children's diverse meanings of community shape and are shaped by the social, cultural, and physical environments of their everyday lives. To explore these meanings I combine principles of child-centered research and qualitative geovisualization into a research methodology. I demonstrate that this integration displays the transformative nature of qualitative analysis and visualization to support interpretive analysis of various forms of qualitative and spatial data together, and offers us a hybrid methodological framework for gaining insights into the diverse meanings of community held by the children. The main case study is drawn from a multi-year research collaboration called the Children's Urban Geography (ChUG), in which I participated along with children who lived in a relatively poor but emerging multi-cultural Hispanic neighborhood in Buffalo, NY.	10.1080/14733285.2014.964666	2015
105	Protected areas provide important ecosystem services globally but few studies have examined how cultural differences influence the distribution of cultural ecosystem values and management preferences. We used internet-based public participation GIS (PPGIS) in the countries of Norway and Poland to identify ecosystem values and management preferences in protected areas held by regional residents and site users. We found significant differences in the type and quantity of ecosystem values with Norwegians mapping more values relating to use of resources (e.g., hunting/fishing, gathering) and Polish respondents mapping more environmental values such as scenery, biological diversity, and water quality. With respect to management preferences, Norwegians identified more preferences for resource utilization while Polish respondents identified more preferences for conservation. Norwegian respondents were more satisfied with protected area management and local participation which can be explained by historical, legal, and cultural differences between the two countries. For Norway, biodiversity conservation in protected areas will continue to be guided by sustainable use of protected areas, rather than strict nature protection, with management favoring local board control and active public participation. For Poland, change in protected area management to enhance biodiversity conservation is less certain, driven by national environmental values that conflict with local values and preferences, continuing distrust in government, and low levels of civic participation. Differential efficacy in PPGIS methods Norway with greater participation from household sampling and Poland with greater response using social media suggest different strategies will be required for effective public engagement in protected area planning and management.

106	The island of Nantucket has, in the last fifty years, undergone great social and environmental changes. Using geographic information systems (GIS) and building on principles of grounded visualizationthe visualization of qualitative data to detect trends and patternsand mixed methods research, we employ a cartographic construct of oral histories to investigate how changes were perceived on the island. We found that respondents concentrated largely on economic factors rather than abstract concepts when articulating change and interpreted historical events, even relatively distant ones, employing a narrative of the island's past that was largely a construction of a small elite of visionaries. ????????????,???????????????????????(GIS),?????????????????????????????????????,???????????,???????????????,?????????????????,??????,???????,?????????????,????????????????????????????

107	The identification of spatial associations between perceived ecosystem values and physical landscapes is confronted by a diversity of mapping methods, heterogeneous human populations, and variability in physical landscape classification systems. This study reviews previous research on spatial associations and reports new empirical findings from Norway to describe the potential for spatial \\value transfer\\" methods that extrapolate ecosystem values to other locations. Public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey methods were implemented in two separate study areas in Norway to identify ecosystem values and to analyze their spatial association with land cover data. The ecosystem value associations with land cover were generally consistent with global findings reported elsewhere, with forested areas providing multiple ecosystem \\"bundles\\" supporting both recreation-related and provisioning values. Alternative value transfer methods were demonstrated using recreation value to compare actual with predicted distributions using land cover indices derived from value proportions, deviations from expected distribution, and correlation coefficients with ecosystem value bundles. The use of simple ecosystem value percentages located within land cover classes provided the best predictive results for value transfer in this study. The limitations and potential for value transfer methods based on spatial associations between mapped ecosystem values and physical landscape characteristics are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

108	Our wellbeing depends upon the services provided by ecosystems and their components. Despite recent advances in academic understanding of ecosystem services, and consideration in UK national environmental policy, a greater awareness is needed at community and individual levels. Dynamic features of virtual globe applications have considerable potential for helping convey the multi-dimensional context of ecosystem services and promoting general awareness. In a case study targeting residents in a small urban fringe river catchment in Norfolk, UK, representatives from local authorities and responsible agencies collaborated with scientists to produce extensive customisation of virtual globes in this context. By implementing a virtual flight over the catchment, different views and scales are traversed to set the context for landscape features and ecosystem services. Characteristic sites, e.g. supplying cultural services, are displayed and relationships with the natural environment are explained using linked on-screen text. Implementation is cost-effective and described for practitioners in ecosystem and landscape management, who may be inexperienced in landscape visualisation. Supplied as three pre-packaged virtual tours, products are made available for download and are publicised at a variety of engagement events, including teaching events with schoolchildren. The tours have attracted public interest and generated positive feedback about improving knowledge of local natural assets. Schoolchildren show confidence with the interface, but supplementary problem based activities can improve learning opportunities. The capacity of virtual globes to support more participatory involvement of the public in local ecosystem management may increase in the future, but such visualisations can already help promote community awareness of local landscape benefits.

109	Sophisticated geospatial modeling of environmental problems and hazards is far advanced in geography, decision science, and related fields. The political ecological application of these tools, especially in visualizing, debating, and contesting risk, is underdeveloped, however. By using visualizations of risk as an analytical tool to explore the views of citizens and county health officials, geospatial models can help to explore the schisms, connections, and associations among complex landscapes, diverse publics, and logics of governance. In this paper, we explore the case of West Nile virus in the Southwest United States, a site where county health departments, vector control districts, and urban residents practice varying methods of mosquito management. We created geospatial visualizations of mosquito microhabitat using a dynamic simulation model and remotely sensed imagery. These data, when differentially aggregated, produced divergent visualizations of mosquito risk spaces across the city of Tucson. Presenting maps to neighborhood residents and local health officials, we found they invited different understandings of spatialized areas of responsibility for mosquito management. Neighborhood focus groups expressed territorial notions of risk and responsibility that diverged widely from those of health officials. Visualizations were shown to both reflect and produce different mosquito narratives, showing how mapped models can help elicit political-ecological insight into the territorialization of mosquito control.

110	In recent years, we have seen the emergence of sound mapping, through which users can share their recordings of sounds via online mapping platforms. These practices are enabled by an array of spatial and digital technologies that also facilitate the growth of the so-called volunteered geographic information (VGI) regarding contributions from users without training in conventional GIS or cartography. In the growing body of work on VGI, however, not much attention has been given to the emergence of such sound maps as part of the VGI constructions. Meanwhile, research in soundscape has not addressed the aspect of crowd-sourcing or user-generated contributions facilitated by new information and communication technologies. This article seeks to bridge this gap. It draws upon important insights from critical GIS research into investigating VGI as visual practices, while it is also informed by three areas of soundscape research including mapping soundscapes, tracing the production of soundscapes and exploring embodied experiences with soundscapes. Through an empirical case in China, this article suggests a two-level analytical framework: investigating in what ways crowd-sourced sound maps emerge and interpreting these sounds on their shared platforms. In so doing, this study calls for more engagement with the multi-modality aspect of visuality in mappings, which in turn may have implications for landscape design and planning. In this way, it seeks to enrich the discussion on critical visualization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.08.007	2015
111	Big data is increasingly seen as a way of providing a more 'scientific' approach to the understanding and management of cities. But most geographic analyses of geotagged social media data have failed to mobilize a sufficiently complex understanding of socio-spatial relations. By combining the conceptual approach of relational socio-spatial theory with the methods of critical GIScience, this paper explores the spatial imaginaries and processes of segregation and mobility at play in the notion of the '9th Street Divide' in Louisville, Kentucky. Through a more context-sensitive analysis of this data, this paper argues against this popular spatial imaginary and the notion that the Louisville's West End is somehow separate and apart from the rest of the city. By analyzing the everyday activity spaces of different groups of Louisvillians through geotagged Twitter data, we instead argue for an understanding of these neighborhoods as fluid, porous and actively produced, rather than as rigid, static or fixed. Ultimately, this paper is meant to provide a conceptual and methodological framework for the analysis of social media data that is more attentive to the multiplicity of socio-spatial relations embodied in such data.

129	There is increasing recognition of the importance for local biodiversity of post-mining sites, many of which lie near communities that have suffered significant social and economic deprivation as the result of mine closures. However, no studies to date have actively used the knowledge of local communities to relate the history and treatment of post-mining sites to their current ecological status. We report a study of two post-mining sites in the Yorkshire coalfield of the UK in which the local community were involved in developing site histories and assessing plant and invertebrate species composition. Site histories developed using participatory GIS revealed that the sites had a mixture of areas of spontaneous succession and technical reclamation, and identified that both planned management interventions and informal activities influenced habitat heterogeneity and ecological diversity. Two groups of informal activity were identified as being of particular importance. Firstly, there has been active protection by the community of flower-rich habitats of conservation value (e.g. calcareous grassland) and distinctive plant species (e.g. orchids) which has also provided important foraging resources for butterfly and bumblebee species. Secondly, disturbance by activities such as use of motorbikes, informal camping, and cutting of trees and shrubs for fuel, as well as planned management interventions such as spreading of brick rubble, has provided habitat for plant species of open waste ground and locally uncommon invertebrate species which require patches of bare ground. This study demonstrates the importance of informal, and often unrecorded, activities by the local community in providing diverse habitats and increased biodiversity within a post-mining site, and shows that active engagement with the local community and use of local knowledge can enhance ecological interpretation of such sites and provide a stronger basis for successful future management.	10.1371/journal.pone.0136522	2015
112	This article reviews the state of \\critical cartography\\" which is being experimented with exuberance in a number of disciplines and arenas: geographers, community development activists, artists, and new media innovators, to name a few. The promise and possibilities of debunking and retooling cartography are significant: by opening up who can make a map and the kinds of maps that are made, overlooked phenomena can be reclaimed, different perspectives can be made apparent, and new knowledge constructed. However, the conditions under which the emancipatory potential of critical cartography might be realized need to be investigated. This article critiques the claims that current new mapping practices increase participation and democracy and outlines four issues critical cartography needs to further develop in order to increase its potential: 1) greater reflexivity on the critical cartographer's own position and influence of the project, 2) acknowledgement of the choices made of what not to include in the map, 3) greater consideration about the politics of aesthetics, 4) expanded search for deeper social engagement with new mapping projects. The article also discusses these issues through a case study map project of street vendors contesting the use of sidewalk space in Ho Chi Minh City. It explores the qualities a non-participatory, authored map project might engender critical visualization through processes of spatial ethnography. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

113	In recent years, geospatial design (or geodesign) has emerged as an area of technological development, GIScience research, and design practice. With Esri leading the branding of this emerging area, geospatial technology developers, design consultancies, and academic units are recognizing the affordances of applying geovisualization and geoanalytical techniques to more conventional practices within design and planning fields. Additionally, the GISciences are being called to rearticulate their research agendas in the face of 'big data' and neogeography. This paper examines these developments with regard to criticality, or the ways in which mapping practices are applied in critical research - both research that seeks to situate the emergence of geospatial technologies and enrolls these technologies more directly as method. What is the criticality of mapping practices amid these developments? More specifically to the design and planning fields, how might geodesign align with critical GIS? I take up these questions by tracing three presuppositions of criticality in mapping while examining the conditions of geodesign's emergence: representation and futurity, neutrality and efficacy, and relationality and complexity. I conclude by outlining a research agenda for further advancement of a critical geodesign. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.12.017	2015
114	In this commentary, I explore the notion of criticality presented in the three articles in this section of the special issue. I argue that the central concern of critical visualization is to make visible (reveal) the experiences of social groups whose concerns are largely invisible in contemporary discursive environment of landscape and urban planning.

115	The Florida Keys is recognized as the birth place of flats fishing, but the flats fishery has historically been underappreciated by resource managers because it is a catch and release fishery. However, the fishery is increasingly threatened by habitat degradation and user conflicts. Ongoing regulatory revisions in the Florida Keys prompted us to work with flats fishing guides to document spatial fishing coverage and habitats so that this information could be included in management revisions. We used a geostatistical approach to create contour maps depicting fishing coverage and habitats, and provided this information to resource managers. This participatory GIS approach engages stakeholders in the management process, uses their knowledge of the resource, and contributes to resource and fisheries conservation. This study, in combination with research on the economic impact of the flats fishery, presents the flats fishery as an important conservation tool for the region and underscores the implication of relationships between researchers and data providers in the saltwater recreational fishery.	10.1007/s10641-015-0435-z	2015
116	Situated at the intersection of the arts and sciences, Humanities GIS (HumGIS) are contributing to new knowledge systems emerging in the digital, spatial, and geo-humanities. This article discusses the conceptualization and operationalization of two HumGIS models engaging the cartographical and discursive tools employed by James Joyce to compose Ulysses ([1922] 1992). The first model is used to perform a visual geo-literary historical analysis by transposing Homeric and Dantean topologies on a spatialized narrative of Joyce's work. The second model integrates Ulysses within a social media map to interpret Bloomsday 2014 digital ecosystem spatial performances in Dublin and globally. This article suggests that HumGIS models reflecting human contingency, idiosyncrasy, and affect, drawing on literary, historical, and social media tools, sources, and perceptions, might offer GIScience, neogeography, and big data studies alternative spatial framings and modeling scenarios. Ubicados en la interseccion de las artes y las ciencias, los SIG Humanidades (HumSIG) estan contribuyendo en los sistemas de nuevo conocimiento que surgen en las humanidades digitales, espaciales y geograficas. En este articulo se discuten la conceptualizacion y operacionalizacion de dos modelos HumSIG que involucran las herramientas cartograficas y discursivas empleadas por James Joyce para armar el Ulises ([1922]1992). El primero de estos modelos se usa para representar un analisis historico geoliterario de caracter visual, transponiendo topologias homericas y dantescas a una narrativa espacializada del trabajo de Joyce. El segundo modelo integra a Ulises dentro de un mapa de medios sociales para interpretar las representaciones espaciales del ecosistema digital Bloomsday de 2014 en Dublin y globalmente. Este articulo sugiere que los modelos HumSIG, al reflejar la contingencia humana, la idiosincrasia y el afecto, con el apoyo de herramientas, fuentes y percepciones literarias, historicas y de los medios sociales, podrian ofrecer a los estudios de SIGciencia, neogeografia y big data una alternativa de marcos espaciales y escenarios de modelado.	10.1080/00045608.2015.1054252	2015
117	In this paper, we argue that place mapping is useful for approaching children's conception of place and that this is of relevance when designing physical activity interventions. We contend that socio-material factors influence children's perception and use of places, and are crucial to understand in relation to their use of local neighbourhoods for physical activity. A place mapping of children's understandings and everyday use of their local neighbourhood in suburban Copenhagen was conducted with a fifth grade elementary school class. The mapping and subsequent analysis resulted in three categories of relevance to children's conceptions of place; located social experiences, experiences of the unknown, and children's contested spaces. We argue that such knowledge can provide useful information in the development and evaluation of activities that promote physical activity in urban spaces.	10.1080/14733285.2014.927052	2015
118	It is increasingly recognized that ecosystems provide varied services that should be considered in land management decisions. One of the challenges in the valuation of landscapes is that they often provide multiple services that combine into one social-ecological system. In this article we show how overlaps of those services can be measured, visualized, and explained. The results from a case study conducted in a rural community in northern Namibia show that in some landscapes, services are intertwined. We draw on a practice approach and ethnographic data to explain this finding and argue that services are related within places and fields of action. More specifically, we show that material services such as the provision of food and income form a unified whole with nonmaterial or cultural services such as beauty and social interaction and are often experienced simultaneously.Research for this article is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and is part of The Future Okavango (TFO) project on anthropogenic influences and cultural dimensions of environmental uses in the Okavango catchment (www.future-okavango.org).This is an Open Access article.

119	Investigative analysts gather data from different sources, especially from social media (SM), in order to shed light on cognitive factors that may explain criminal spatial behavior. A former research shows how tweets can be used to estimate private points of interest. Authors' aim was to demonstrate, as they extend the analysis to a wider statistical base, how social maps and Web applications could be used in investigative analysis and spatial cognition research. A total of 100 Twitter accounts with approximately 250 tweets each were submitted to common geographical techniques (measures such as Convex-Hull, Mean-Center, Median-Center, Standard-Deviation-Ellipse) in order to test the hypothesis that user areas of activity are predictable. Predictions were tested through a set of specific information: clear reference to areas of activity and clear reference about user's residence. Simple algorithms and procedures demonstrated that they could be used to predict where SM users live, giving positive results in about 4/5 cases and giving indications about their home location. In fact, all home positions were found in the Convex-Hull and most of them in the Standard-Deviation-Ellipse. Furthermore, in up to 80 % of cases, houses were found within a buffer zone of 1.500 m with Median-Center as centrum (70 % using Median-Center as centrum) with a minimum effectiveness threshold of 12-13 tweets. SM may help in studying people mobility and their cognition of space and, moreover, where they live, or their traveling behavior. The processing of geographical data in conjunction with the SM analysis may facilitate the construction of models describing specific behavior of people. The use of geographical information system tools and SM analysis represents an effective approach in order to acquire spatial and territorial information, referred to social relationship. The results may be used successfully in the understanding of social dynamics and for the prevention of criminal behavior.	10.1007/s10339-015-0711-z	2015
120	Area restrictions prohibiting people from entering drug scenes or areas where they were arrested are a common socio-legal mechanism employed to regulate the spatial practices of people who use drugs (PWUD). To explore how socio-spatial patterns stemming from area restrictions shape risk, harm, and health care access, qualitative interviews and mapping exercises were conducted with 24 PWUD with area restrictions in Vancouver, Canada. Area restrictions disrupted access to health and social resources (e.g., HIV care) concentrated in drug scenes, while territorial stigma prevented PWUD from accessing supports in other neighborhoods. Rather than preventing involvement in drug-related activities, area restrictions displaced these activities to other locations and increased vulnerability to diverse risks and harms (e.g., unsafe drug use practices, violence). Given the harms stemming from area restrictions there is an urgent need to reconsider this socio-legal strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	10.1016/j.healthplace.2015.07.006	2015
121	Background: As part of the Charleston Area Pollution Prevention Partnership (CAPs), studies have been performed to address environmental health issues using various techniques including Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping. Most of the mapping has been conducted by academic team members; however, there is a need for more community-based mapping to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of community-driven efforts to eliminate environmental hazards and health disparities. The emergence of public participatory GIS (PPGIS) has been shown as a way to democratize science, build community capacity, and empower local citizens to address environmental health issues. Purpose: This article describes the development of the Environmental Justice (EJ) Radar, a PPGIS tool that provides stakeholders in South Carolina with a way to raise environmental awareness and improve citizen participation in local environmental decision-making. We describe the functionality of EJ Radar and discuss feedback received from stakeholders to improve the utility of the PPGIS tool.	NA	2015
122	Background Childhood obesity has been rising rapidly in the USA. The rate is higher among those at a lower socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minority groups. In Alabama, nearly half of the children from rural African American families are overweight or obese. Studies suggest that children's eating behaviours and weight could be influenced by surrounding food environments. The purpose of this paper is to assess the community food environment and examine the associations with childhood obesity in Alabama's Black Belt region. Methods This research uses both qualitative and quantitative methods. Weight status of 613 African American students in four elementary schools in a rural county of Alabama was assessed. We examined community food environments around children's home through GIS (Geographic Information System) and statistical methods. The interrelations between children's weight and community food environments are explored with multi-level models. Results Approximately 42.1% of surveyed children were overweight or obese, much higher than the national average, 30.6%. In Model 1, convenience stores (3.44; P < 0.01), full service restaurants (8.99; P < 0.01) and supermarkets (-37.69; P < 0.01) were significantly associated with the percentile of body mass index. Fast food stores (-0.93; P = 0.88) were not related to children's weight. In Model 2, the additions of sociodemographic factors and school effects cause significant changes of the relationships between children's weight and four types of food outlets. The percentage of African American population (90.23, P < 0.01) and school (6.68, P < 0.01) were positively associated with children's weight; while median household income (-39.6; P < 0.01) was negatively related to it. Conclusion Children's weight is influenced by community food environments, sociodemographic factors and school context. Findings suggest that policymakers and planners need to improve community food environments of low-income minority communities. Parents and schools should pay more attention to reduce the negative impacts of food environments on children.	10.1111/cch.12204	2015
130	Future climate in the Nordic countries is expected to become warmer, wetter, and wilder', and this will probably cause more extreme weather events. Therefore, local authorities need to improve their ability to assess weather-related hazards such as floods, landslides, and storms, as well as people's sensitivity and capacity to cope with or adjust to such events. In this article, we present an integrated assessment of vulnerability to natural hazards, which incorporates both exposure and social vulnerability. In our assessment, we screen places and rank them by their relative scores on exposure and vulnerability indices. We also design a web-based visualization tool - ViewExposed - that shows maps that reveal a considerable geographic variation in integrated vulnerability. ViewExposed makes it easy to identify the places with the highest integrated vulnerability, and it facilitates the understanding of the factors that make these places exposed and/or vulnerable. For empirical validation, we correlate the exposure indices with insurance claims due to natural damage. However, we also emphasize the importance of a dialog with relevant stakeholders to ensure a participatory validation. Our top-down exposure and vulnerability assessment benefits from a participatory bottom-up assessment. This is crucial to support decisions about where to implement adaptive and preventive measures against hazards related to climate change.	10.1080/13669877.2014.923027	2015
123	Understanding the relationship between humans and their environment is essential for the planning and management of social-ecological systems but integration of social values with biophysical landscape information remains challenging. Identifying areas that are likely to be pivotal in land use planning decisions from both social and ecological perspectives provides one means of integration. Social-ecological \\hotspots\\" represent valuable areas from both human and environmental perspectives but appropriate and valid methods for identifying such areas are under-developed. We applied an inductive research approach using empirical spatial data from a regional study in Australia to evaluate alternative methods for identifying social-ecological hotspots. Social data measuring the importance of the landscape was collected using public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) while ecologically valuable areas were identified from species distributions and Zonation conservation prioritization software. We applied multiple importance thresholds (cut-offs) to separately identify and measure social and ecological hotspots, and then quantified the degree of spatial concurrence (overlap) when combining the layers to generate social-ecological hotspots. Based on the findings, we developed guidelines for identifying social-ecological hotspots under variable data conditions. We describe the practical implications of our findings by showing how the selected method for SES hotspot identification can enhance or limit the utility of hotspot analysis for decision support in regional conservation planning.

124	Asthma is complex and connected to a number of factors including access to healthcare, crime and violence, and environmental triggers. A mixed method approach was used to examine the experiences of urban people with asthma in controlling their asthma symptoms. The study started with an initial phase of qualitative interviews in West Philadelphia, a primarily poor African American community. Data from qualitative, semi-structured interviews indicated that stress, environmental irritants, and environmental allergens were the most salient triggers of asthma. Based on the interviews, the team identified six neighborhood factors to map including crime, housing vacancy, illegal dumping, tree canopy and parks. These map layers were combined into a final composite map. These combined methodologies contextualized respondents' perceptions in the framework of the actual community and built environment which tells a more complete story about their experience with asthma.

125	Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is increasingly used to assess land use plans in a way that is broader in spatial, temporal and conceptual scope than traditional Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Meanwhile, conservation scientists have recognised that successful biodiversity conservation outcomes rely on information about both biological priorities and the feasibility of undertaking conservation actions. SEA provides a framework for integrating information on the social determinants of conservation feasibility with supporting environmental legislation in order to achieve enhanced conservation outcomes. In this paper we argue that data on the social context of land use plans are vital to ensure effective biodiversity conservation outcomes that result from SEAs. We explore the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) (EPBC Act) as a case example of how the integration of these data can be practically achieved within an existing legal process. While a range of social data is relevant to this type of assessment, we focus on the use of spatially-referenced social data in the context of land use planning. When applied to the design and implementation of land use plans, this type of information can improve the acceptability of conservation actions, enhance environmental stewardship, and minimise land use conflict through taking stock of the values and attitudes (precursors to behaviour) that are relevant to proposed land use change and conservation action. Through exploring the integration of these data into each of the stages of SEA under the EPBC Act, we show that opportunities exist to strengthen the effectiveness of SEA in delivering conservation outcomes without altering existing legal processes. Yet, for this to be done effectively, practitioners need to be cognisant of a range of theoretical and methodological challenges related to the generation and interpretation of these data, as well as the socio-political context in which they are applied.

126	The value of mixed-methods research has recently re-gained impetus among geographers interested in the production of knowledge (Elwood, 2010). Key conversations have centred on efforts to blend traditionally viewed quantitative tools such as GIS with more qualitative practices and data. While discussions in qualitative GIS have demonstrated the value of merging the qualitative in GIS, we highlight the unexplored potential of GIS in the enactment of qualitative research, specifically as visual method. Our argument is based on research which explored the role of the state in urban change in Dublin City. We conclude that there is significant potential to better incorporate GIS into visual methods, particularly through photo-elicitation style interviews. Contrary to some of the existing literature, the persuasive power of the map as visual resource can prove particularly successful in engaging elite stakeholders. Further, we conclude that the methodological approach we took, facilitated the production of different kinds of knowledge around processes of urban governance.	10.1177/0042098014545520	2015
127	The marine environment provides significant benefits to many local communities. Pressure to develop coastal waterways worldwide creates an urgent need for tools to locate marine spaces that have important social or ecological values, and to quantify their relative importance. The primary objective of this study was to develop, apply and critically assess a tool to identify important social-ecological hotspots in the marine environment. The study was conducted in a typical coastal community in northern British Columbia, Canada. This expert-informed GIS, or xGIS, tool used a survey instrument to draw on the knowledge of local experts from a range of backgrounds with respect to a series of 12 social-ecological value attributes, such as biodiversity, cultural and economic values. We identified approximately 1500 polygons on marine maps and assigned relative values to them using a token distribution exercise. A series of spatial statistical analyses were performed to locate and quantify the relative social-ecological importance of marine spaces and the results were ultimately summarized in a single hotspot map of the entire study area. This study demonstrates the utility of xGIS as a useful tool for stakeholders and environmental managers engaged in the planning and management of marine resources at the local and regional levels.

131	Many users of online interactive maps have substantial problems interacting with these maps. The main goal of this paper is to explore the issues related to the interaction with GIS-based interactive online maps. An example is taken from a Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) created for the inhabitants in Wilhelmsburg, a city district of Hamburg, Germany. The application was developed within a European project and tested in two phases: first with the inhabitants of Wilhelmsburg and second with a group of students of urban planning with some basic GIS skills. In this article, we present the results of testing with both groups and discuss open research and practical issues related to the interaction with online interactive maps. We conclude the article with a list of relevant research topics which address this interaction and the consequences the design of online maps can have on the ability of the user to use them efficiently.	10.1080/15230406.2014.991427	2015
132	Background: A call has recently been made by the public health and medical communities to understand the neighborhood context of a patient's life in order to improve education and treatment. To do this, methods are required that can collect \\contextual\\" characteristics while complementing the spatial analysis of more traditional data. This also needs to happen within a standardized, transferable, easy-to-implement framework. Methods: The Spatial Video Geonarrative (SVG) is an environmentally-cued narrative where place is used to stimulate discussion about fine-scale geographic characteristics of an area and the context of their occurrence. It is a simple yet powerful approach to enable collection and spatial analysis of expert and resident health-related perceptions and experiences of places. Participants comment about where they live or work while guiding a driver through the area. Four GPS-enabled cameras are attached to the vehicle to capture the places that are observed and discussed by the participant. Audio recording of this narrative is linked to the video via time stamp. A program (G-Code) is then used to geotag each word as a point in a geographic information system (GIS). Querying and density analysis can then be performed on the narrative text to identify spatial patterns within one narrative or across multiple narratives. This approach is illustrated using case studies on post-disaster psychopathology, crime, mosquito control, and TB in homeless populations. Results: SVG can be used to map individual, group, or contested group context for an environment. The method can also gather data for cohorts where traditional spatial data are absent. In addition, SVG provides a means to spatially capture, map and archive institutional knowledge. Conclusions: SVG GIS output can be used to advance theory by being used as input into qualitative and/or spatial analyses. SVG can also be used to gain near-real time insight therefore supporting applied interventions. Advances over existing geonarrative approaches include the simultaneous collection of video data to visually support any commentary, and the ease-of-application making it a transferable method across different environments and skillsets."	10.1186/s12942-015-0014-8	2015
133	Spatial technologies and the organizations around them, such as the Standby Task Force and Ushahidi, are increasingly changing the ways crises and emergencies are addressed. Within digital humanitarianism, Big Data has featured strongly in recent efforts to improve digital humanitarian work. This shift toward social media and other Big Data sources has entailed unexamined assumptions about technological progress, social change, and the kinds of knowledge captured by data. These assumptions stand in tension with critical geographic scholarship, and in particular critical GIS research. In this paper I borrow from critical research on technologies to engage three important new facets of Big Data emerging from an interrogation of digital humanitarianism. I argue first that within digital humanitarianism, Big Data should be understood as a new set of practices, in addition to its usual conception as data and analytics technologies. Second, I argue that Big Data constitutes a distinct epistemology that obscures many forms of knowledge in crises and emergencies and produces a limited understanding of how a crisis is unfolding. Third, I argue that Big Data is constitutive of a social relation in which both the formal humanitarian sector and \\victims'' of crises are in need of the services and labor that can be provided by digital humanitarians."	10.1007/s10708-014-9599-x	2015
134	Background: Access to health services such as palliative care is determined not only by health policy but a number of legacies linked to geography and settlement patterns. We use GIS to calculate potential spatio-temporal access to palliative care services. In addition, we combine qualitative data with spatial analysis to develop a unique mixed-methods approach. Methods: Inpatient health care facilities with dedicated palliative care beds were sampled in two Canadian provinces: Newfoundland and Saskatchewan. We then calculated one-hour travel time catchments to palliative health services and extended the spatial model to integrate available beds as well as documented wait times. Results: 26 facilities with dedicated palliative care beds in Newfoundland and 69 in Saskatchewan were identified. Spatial analysis of one-hour travel times and palliative beds per 100,000 population in each province showed distinctly different geographical patterns. In Saskatchewan, 96.7 % of the population living within a-1 h of drive to a designated palliative care bed. In Newfoundland, 93.2 % of the population aged 65+ were living within a-1 h of drive to a designated palliative care bed. However, when the relationship between wait time and bed availability was examined for each facility within these two provinces, the relationship was found to be weak in Newfoundland (R-2 = 0.26) and virtually nonexistent in Saskatchewan (R-2 = 0.01). Conclusions: Our spatial analysis shows that when wait times are incorporated as a way to understand potential spatio-temporal access to dedicated palliative care beds, as opposed to spatial access alone, the picture of access changes.	10.1186/s12913-015-0909-x	2015
135	More effective collaboration is a recurring theme to improve public participation in planning. But collaborative processes are constrained by the number of people that can participate, limiting the diversity and independence of planning participants resulting in suboptimal planning outcomes. This article argues that crowd sourcing and public judgement using public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) can result in better planning outcomes. The wisdom of crowds refers to a phenomenon where collective opinion generates superior solutions to a problem than can be obtained by any individual in the group; public judgement refers to high-quality public opinion that is firm, consistent and mindful of consequences. PPGIS is a means to operationalise and translate the wisdom of crowds and public judgement into spatially explicit information for land use decisions. This article presents the conditions for engaging crowd wisdom and public judgement using PPGIS to collect spatially explicit planning information, followed by examples that illustrate the benefits. Technology exists to expand the use of PPGIS for planning, but there is resistance from influential segments of society that do not trust the wisdom of crowds. Innovators within planning practice are encouraged to provide opportunities to test and evaluate crowd-sourced planning solutions.	10.1080/07293682.2015.1034147	2015
136	Recent advances in Web technologies have opened avenues to create socio-technical platforms that can empower citizens in urban planning processes. The rise of the GeoWeb and the popularity of Web 2.0 collaborative tools can facilitate the development of a new generation of bottom-up Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) platforms that can incorporate user-generated content into Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). New service-based delivery mechanisms can provide architectural flexibility and adaptability, and enable the public to benefit from ubiquitous information access. From an e-participation perspective, Web 2.0 social networking functions support interactive communication among various PPGIS stakeholders, e.g., citizens, planners, and decision makers. The main contribution of this article is to present a reference architecture for e-planning platforms that (1) facilitates effective e-participation by allowing multidirectional map-based communication among various land development stakeholders (e.g., planners, decision makers, citizens, etc.), and (2) enables incorporation of visualization, evaluation, and discussion capabilities to support community planning processes. To achieve this, we developed a service-oriented architecture (SOA) that exploits SDI principles and Web 2.0 technologies. The platform architecture allows heterogeneous data sources, analytical functionality and tools, and presentation frameworks to be plugged into a coherent system to provide a planning and decision support platform. We present two real-world implementations of the proposed architecture that have been developed to support community engagement in the City of Calgary, Canada.	10.1080/13658816.2015.1008492	2015
137	Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) is a very broad field, and because of the direct outgrowth addressing questions raised regarding inequitable access to GIS and its societal impacts, PPGIS has become an exhaustive research area. Over the past two decades, several PPGIS initiatives have taken place in the western and non-western world. Several avenues have opened up, but nonetheless, questions regarding the effectiveness of such initiatives remain to be answered. Current research addressing the societal and political impacts of GIS have witnessed novel use of the technology and specialized spatial data provision such as volunteered geographic information, neogeography, geoweb, and map 2.0 (Goodchild, 2007; Elwood 2010; Sui 2008) and have received increased attention from GIS scholars (Goodchild 2007; Elwood 2009; Sui 2008). A common thread tying such specialized use of technology is the participation by citizens with little or no GIS training, a long standing objective of the PPGIS area of inquiry. So, as we move into an era that is gravitating rapidly toward more specialized use of technology built on a similar foundation, it seems timely to reflect on the effectiveness and sustainability of PPGIS initiatives. This article reviews the history of PPGIS, its genesis, and some of the critical work within the PPGIS research arena. Finally, the paper reflects on where PPGIS stands today.	10.1111/gec3.12223	2015
138	Robust risk assessment requires accurate flood intensity area mapping to allow for the identification of populations and elements at risk. However, available flood maps in West Africa lack spatial variability while global datasets have resolutions too coarse to be relevant for local scale risk assessment. Consequently, local disaster managers are forced to use traditional methods such as watermarks on buildings and media reports to identify flood hazard areas. In this study, remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques were combined with hydrological and statistical models to delineate the spatial limits of flood hazard zones in selected communities in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Benin. The approach involves estimating peak runoff concentrations at different elevations and then applying statistical methods to develop a Flood Hazard Index (FHI). Results show that about half of the study areas fall into high intensity flood zones. Empirical validation using statistical confusion matrix and the principles of Participatory GIS show that flood hazard areas could be mapped at an accuracy ranging from 77% to 81%. This was supported with local expert knowledge which accurately classified 79% of communities deemed to be highly susceptible to flood hazard. The results will assist disaster managers to reduce the risk to flood disasters at the community level where risk outcomes are first materialized.	10.3390/w7073531	2015
139	ObjectivesThe purpose of this program development and evaluation project was to promote healthy families and communities by creating academic-practice partnerships, educating BSN students and building family-nursing student partnerships that were supported by a village of interconnected resources. Design and SampleA mixed-methods design was used for the project. Data were collected from a convenience sample of vulnerable families, BSN students engaged in PHN practica, and partner members. MeasuresNine tools were developed to capture data over two semesters including a GIS mapping strategy. ResultsOne hundred and seventy-five home visits were completed with 20 families, 14 of whom needed interpreter assistance. Families reported satisfaction with the quality of home visits, education, and assistance toward health goals. Fifty-three students provided 202 educational interventions, 39 community resource connections, and 46 care transitions. Students reported linking theory with practice and valued the PHN practicum experience. Academic-practice partners identified opportunities for program development and sustainability. GIS mapping illustrated complex family linkages to community resources. ConclusionsResults suggest that young, vulnerable families benefit from public health nursing (PHN) home visits, but sustaining home visit programs is challenging. Academic-practice partnerships can guide students and families partnered in a reciprocal relationship with village resources.	10.1111/phn.12135	2015
140	Public lands provide significant environmental, economic, and social values to society across a range of classifications and tenures. Stakeholders representing multiple interests are presumed to hold different management preferences for these lands. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate how stakeholder perspectives can influence place-based management preferences for public lands. We developed a multidimensional public land preference scale and used cluster analysis of responses to classify individuals (n = 1507) into stakeholder groups using data collected from a large public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey in Victoria, Australia. We analyzed the results of the two largest stakeholder groups (identified as \\Preservation\\" and \\"Recreation\\") to assess their spatial preferences for public land conservation, access, and development. We developed a method to assess the level of spatial stakeholder agreement, with the results identifying geographic areas of both agreement and disagreement between stakeholder groups. To determine the effects of unequal stakeholder participation in mapping, we performed sensitivity analysis by weighting the responses of the Recreation stakeholder group to approximate the mapping effort of the Preservation stakeholder group. The place-based management preferences changed significantly for conservation/development and improving/limiting public land access, while preferences for increasing/limiting facility development were less sensitive to stakeholder weighting. The spatial mapping of stakeholder preferences appears effective for identifying locations with high potential for conflict as well as areas of agreement, but would benefit from further research in a range of land management applications to provide further guidance on the analysis of stakeholder group responses that result from diverse stakeholder group participation.

141	Numerous exegeses have been written about the epistemologies of volunteered geographic information (VGI). We contend that VGI is itself a socially constructed epistemology crafted in the discipline of geography, which when re-examined, does not sit comfortably with either GIScience or critical GIS scholarship. Using insights from Albert Borgmann's philosophy of technology we offer a critique that, rather than appreciating the contours of this new form of data, truth appears to derive from traditional analytic views of information found within GIScience. This is assisted by structures that enable VGI to be treated as independent of the process that led to its creation. Allusions to individual emancipation further hamper VGI and problematise participatory practices in mapping/geospatial technologies (e.g. public participation geographic information systems). The paper concludes with implications of this epistemological turn and prescriptions for designing systems and advancing the field to ensure nuanced views of participation within the core conceptualisation of VGI.	10.1002/geo2.10	2015
142	We review public participation GIS (PPGIS) and participatory GIS (PGIS) approaches for ecosystem services to identify current and best practice. PPGIS/PGIS are spatially explicit methods that have evolved over the past decade to identify a range of ecosystem services. Although PPGIS/PGIS methods demonstrate high potential for the identification of ecosystem services, especially cultural services, there has been no review to evaluate the methods to identify best practice. Through examination of peer-reviewed, empirical PPGIS/PGIS studies, we describe the types of ecosystem services mapped, the spatial mapping methods, the sampling approaches and range of participants, the types of spatial analyses performed, and the methodological trade-offs associated with each PPGIS/PGIS mapping approach. We found that multiple methods were implemented in nearly 30 case studies worldwide with the mapping of cultural and provisioning services being most common. There was little evidence that mapped ecosystem data was used for actual decision support in land use planning. Best practice has yet to coalesce in this field that has been dominated by methodological pluralism and case study research. We suggest greater use of experimental design and long-term case studies where the influence of mapped ecosystem services on land use decisions can be assessed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

143	Assuming the huge progress achieved in public participatory geographic information system (PPGIS) techniques and its current research gaps, this study aims to explore differences in the perception of spatial distribution of ecosystem services supply and demand between different stakeholders through collaborative mapping. The stakeholders selected included high influence stakeholder (with a high degree of interest on the ecosystem services' stare and with an important influence into the environmental decision making process) and low influence stakeholders (with a high degree of interest on the ecosystem services' state and with a low influence in environmental management). Workshops took place in June 2013 in two regions of Andalusia; overall 29 participants were involved. Water provision, food from agriculture, livestock, erosion control, climate regulation, water purification, nature tourism, recreational hunting and tranquility were collaboratively mapped. Agriculture land-use and the protected area surface were also assessed in order to Find patterns in ecosystem services supply, meanwhile the role of urban areas was assessed for ecosystem services demand. The results show that low and high influence stakeholders have different perceptions of the spatial distribution of ecosystem services and the scale of their demand. We call for the recognition of these knowledge differences (experiential and technical) and their inclusion in decision making processes regarding landscape planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

144	Economic and biophysical assessments are being used to portray the value of ecosystem services (ES) to decision makers. However, stakeholder uses of ES are rarely considered, nor are intangible cultural values. Public participatory GIS methods enabled for 16 cultural and provisioning ES indicators to be effectively mapped across seven stakeholder groups in an area lacking data. During interviews, polygons representing ES use were drawn by participants and then subsequently analyzed to produce areas of overlapping use, generating ES hotspots for each group, for cultural and provisioning ES, and for all groups combined. In many cases, cultural ES were deemed to be more important to stakeholders than provisioning ES. We demonstrate an effective non-economic tool used to visualize ES use across eight differing stakeholder groups on a regional scale, which were straightforward to disseminate during a decision-making process for a large hydroelectric dam.

145	On April 27, 2011, an EF-4 tornado struck Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Historic damage from the storm coincided with a recessionary economy, a double blow from which the city has yet to recover. This study applied disaster vulnerability theory to a mixed-methods analysis involving qualitative research, photography, and geographic information systems (GIS) analysis in order to document the recovery of three neighborhoods in the tornado zone. One measure of progress is easy to see. Two neighborhoods, both financially stable, have been rebuilt. The third neighborhood has lagged behind the other two, although residents, community leaders, and city planners seek to revitalize this blighted community. Tuscaloosa's experience suggests that prestorm vulnerabilities lead to uneven recovery and proposals for the gentrification of poor neighborhoods that reproduce preexisting patterns of residential segregation.	10.1111/cico.12105	2015
146	Background: The aim of the Activating Schoolyards Study is to develop, implement, document and assess a comprehensive schoolyard intervention to promote physical activity (PA) during school recess for primary school children (grade 4-8). The intervention is designed to implement organizational and structural changes in the physical environment. Method: The study builds on a quasi-experimental study design using a mixed method approach including: 1) an exploratory study aimed at providing input for the developing process; 2) an evaluation of the effect of the interventions using a combination of accelerometer, GPS and GIS; 3) a process evaluation facilitating the intervention development process and identifying barriers and facilitators in the implementation process; 4) a post-intervention end-user evaluation aimed at exploring who uses the schoolyards and how the schoolyards are used. The seven project schools (cases) were selected by means of an open competition and the interventions were developed using a participatory bottom-up approach. Discussion: The participatory approach and case selection strategy make the study design novel. The use of a mixed methods design including qualitative as well as quantitative methods can be seen as a strength, as the different types of data complement each other and results of one part of the study informed the following parts. A unique aspect of our study is the use of accelerometers in combination with GPS and GIS in the effect evaluation to objectively determine where and how active the students are in the schoolyard, before and after the intervention. This provides a type of data that, to our knowledge, has not been used before in schoolyard interventions. Exploring the change in behavior in relation to specific intervention elements in the schoolyard will lead to recommendations for schools undergoing schoolyard renovations at some point in the future.	10.1186/s12889-015-1828-9	2015
164	This study advances the use of grounded visualization through a three-pronged approach that provides an enhanced and more nuanced understanding of public housing issues in Louisville, Kentucky, specifically those faced by residents displaced by HOPE VI revitalization projects. We introduce a rich method - \\drive-by photography\\" - a process of acquiring photos and triggering visual memories, which produces more knowledge than qualitative methods alone. We present the salient themes that emerged from a wealth of qualitative data. Our approach helps bridge the gap between theoretical and applied geography and draws upon earlier work in grounded visualization and qualitative GIS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

147	Alpine environments are increasingly appreciated by nature-based tourism, notwithstanding recent economic crises. To benefit from this and maintain the attractiveness of a tourist destination, it is important to recognise the values of landscapes. We developed and tested a qualitative spatial valuation methodology, integrating existing quantitative survey methods, to support destination management and landscape planning at the local level. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and a mapping exercise at a nature-based tourism destination in northern Italy. In identifying and mapping tourists' perceived landscape values and related threats, we also considered tourist profiles, experiences and preferences. The results indicated three tourist types (active seniors, families and sportive visitors). They identified five different landscape values (scenic, outdoor activity, aesthetic, historical-cultural and tranquillity) and seven categories of threats (urbanisation, lack of maintenance, congestion, visual and/or acoustic disturbance, pollution, overuse, and traffic). The maps show diverse 'tourism landscapes' and provide useful insights into sites with high value or with potential conflict between rival uses, which can effectively ground proposals for the management of valued sites and support local spatial planning to maintain perceived landscape values.	10.1080/01426397.2014.902921	2015
148	Driven by the rise of Web 2.0 and the non-stop spread of mobile device sensors, the concept of Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) is knowing a revolutionary era which perfectly fits the new vision of Digital Earth (DE). This research investigates the opportunity to build up a PPGIS prototype with completely Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) architecture, in which data directly come from field surveys carried out by users. A sample application related to urban monitoring is addressed, which concentrates on user field-collected data concerning reports of road pavement damages. Open Data Kit suite allows users to collect geotagged multimedia information using mobile devices with onboard location sensors (e.g. a Global Positioning System receiver). On field-captured data are sent to a server and stored into a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS spatial extension. GeoServer then disseminates data on the Web. On the client-side, different solutions allow data visualization on both desktop computers and mobile devices. The designed architecture provided support for FOSS usage in the process of gathering, uploading, and Web publishing information collected in situ. The implementation of the developed PPGIS could thus substantially increase public active participation in data creation and sharing, besides enlarging DE knowledge up to the local level.	10.1080/17538947.2014.887150	2015
149	The immediacy of locational information requirements and importance of data currency for natural disaster events highlights the value of volunteered geographic information (VGI) in all stages of disaster management, including prevention, preparation, response, and recovery. The practice of private citizens generating online geospatial data presents new opportunities for the creation and dissemination of disaster-related geographic data from a dense network of intelligent observers. VGI technologies enable rapid sharing of diverse geographic information for disaster management at a fraction of the resource costs associated with traditional data collection and dissemination, but they also present new challenges. These include a lack of data quality assurance and issues surrounding data management, liability, security, and the digital divide. There is a growing need for researchers to explore and understand the implications of these data and data practices for disaster management. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge in this emerging field and present recommendations for future research. Significantly, we note further research is warranted in the pre-event phases of disaster management, where VGI may present an opportunity to connect and engage individuals in disaster preparation and strengthen community resilience to potential disaster events. Our investigation of VGI for disaster management provides broader insight into key challenges and impacts of VGI on geospatial data practices and the wider field of geographical science.	10.1111/gec3.12213	2015
150	Thirteen onshore wind farm projects, totalling approximately 700 wind turbines, are proposed for the West Coast Region (WCR) of the Western Cape Province in South Africa. Wind energy exploitation possesses the ability to transform what can be classified as natural landscapes into landscapes of power, making the type of landscape on which wind turbines are deployed a prominent factor in its social acceptance or rejection. This paper examines the landscape aesthetics and land use interference of proposed wind farms in the WCR of South Africa through determining if social acceptance or rejection of proposed wind farms is dependent on the residents and visitors scenic and land use valuation of the natural landscape. The results indicate that the visual intrusion of wind turbines is the impact that respondents are least concerned with contrasting with the findings of international literature and further reasons for this anomaly are interrogated against the background of South Africa's dire electricity needs. The paper concludes that visual impact assessments alone are not sufficient for evaluating landscapes and this paper recommends that participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) be used in addition to existing wind energy landscape assessments.

151	This paper seeks to understand the use and the consequences of Participatory Geographic Information System (PGIS) in a Mexican local community. A multilevel framework was applied, mainly influenced by two theoretical lenses structurationist view and social shaping of technology structured in three dimensions context, process and content according to contextualist logic. The results of our study have brought two main contributions. The first is the refinement of the theoretical framework in order to better investigate the implementation and use of Information and Communication Technology (ICI) artifacts by local communities for social and environmental purposes. The second contribution is the extension of existing IS (Information Systems) literature on participatory practices through identification of important conditions for helping the mobilization of ICT as a tool for empowering local communities.	10.1590/S0034-759020150305	2015
176	This paper investigates the relationship between cycling and mothers' mobility in Amsterdam. Considering that mothers (still) tend to be responsible for transporting children and doing so on a bicycle may increase the difficulties of travel, the city's push for cycling may not suit mothers' mobility needs. Hence, this research aimed to uncover whether mothers' physical levels and experience of mobility by bicycle are by any means inferior to childless women's in Amsterdam. Activity-travel data, collected among thirty-seven women living and working in Amsterdam, informed the results of this research. Throughout a space-time GIS analysis, mothers barely differed from childless women in their amount of and predilection for cycling: mothers generally did not consider the transport of their children on the bicycle as an exertion or safety issue, but rather as a practical means of transport and a pleasurable moment to bond with children. However, mothers and childless women often differed in their travel schedules and purposes, implying that mothers face specific mobility challenges, which evolve as children grow older.	10.1068/a140373p	2015
152	Sociospatial information is critical to marine and coastal ecosystem management. The Hawaii Coastal Uses Mapping Project used a participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) methodology to gather local knowledge regarding the location and intensity of coastal human activities in Hawaii's priority sites for coral reef management. PGIS provided an efficient and effective means of obtaining information in a data-poor context, particularly at a scale and location where considerable local knowledge is held by community members and resource users. We detail the PGIS methods developed to collect sociospatial data on human uses in the project regions and discuss important considerations regarding the practice of PGIS that emerged from the mapping process, as well as implications for the production and documentation of spatial knowledge. Key themes include: issues of scale and appropriateness in using PGIS as a method for mapping human coastal and marine activities; data validity, authority, and the nature of local knowledge; community trust, engagement, and collaboration; and utility for coral reef management. While several factors limit local agencies' ability to use this spatial information to date, natural resource managers found the participatory mapping process to be highly valuable for stakeholder identification and engagement, and the maps provide a resource to state and federal managers to better understand the human implications of future management scenarios.

153	The last 30 years has seen an increase in environmental, socio-economic, and recreational objectives being considered throughout the forest planning process. In the Finnish context these are considered mainly at the regional level potentially missing out on more local issues and problems. Such local information would be most efficiently collected with a participatory GIS approach. A mobile participatory GIS application called Tienoo was developed as a tool for collecting location-specific opinions of recreational and aesthetical characteristics of forests and forest management. The application also contains information the user can access regarding the practical details of the area, for instance about the recreational infrastructure. The application was tested in Ruunaa National Hiking Area, North Karelia, Eastern Finland. Through this application it is possible to continuously collect geolocated preference information. As a result, the collected opinions have details which can be located in both time and space. This allows for the possibility to monitor the changes in opinions when the stands are treated, and it also allows for easily analyzing the effect of time of year on the opinions. It is also possible to analyze the effect of the spatial location and the forest characteristics on the opinions using GIS analysis.	10.1007/s00267-014-0438-0	2015
154	Increasingly online public access to satellite imagery and the development of qualitative GIS have, in principle, the potential to provide action- and strategic planning approaches with more economical spatial information to monitor and plan physical urban transformation. This is of particular use in rapidly urbanising contexts in the global South, where lack of resources prompted the development of rapid and participatory urban appraisal techniques since the 1990s. However, in such contexts weak institutional capacity, unclear responsibilities and poor integration among key actors may still be major barriers to effective decision-making and implementation of strategic land use plans. In addition, as most urban expansion is driven by popular demand, understanding the nature of this demand has to be the basis for effective supply of urban land etc. This means exploring change in important core social and cultural values, as well as participatory engagement with key stakeholders on immediate and mid-term strategic objectives. This paper reflects on the experience of an Urban Development Priority Action Strategy being developed for the city of Huambo, Angola, by the city administration in partnership with local NGO Development Workshop (DW), with support from a European academic institution, the Centre for Environment & Human Settlements (CEHS). This initiative seeks to embed trans-disciplinarity in a meaningfill manner at the local level to permit the identification and implementation of a realistic set of priority actions. This paper reports on the type of information and understanding that is generated through this approach, as well as on the de facto constraints and boundaries that are created by the relationships between the key stakeholders, their capacities and interests. It also illustrates the more immediate and short-term results that can be achieved through this approach in comparison with traditional master planning approaches including key stakeholder engagement with identified actions and proposal of new organisational and financial models for urban land development and management as well as highlighting the advantages of mutual knowledge exchange between praxis and research.

155	Context Recent papers on the spatial assessment of conservation opportunity have focused on how social values for conservation may change modeled conservation outcomes. Accounting for social factors is important for regional wildlife corridor initiatives as they often emphasize the collaborative aspects of conservation planning. Objectives We present an approach for characterizing the potential effects of public conservation orientation and projected future development land use scenarios on landscape connectivity. Methods Using public participation GIS techniques (mail-based surveys linked to a mapping component), we classified spatially explicit conservation values and preferences into a conservation orientation index consisting of positive, negative, or neutral scores. Connectivity was then modeled using a least-cost path and graph-network approach for a range of conservation orientation and development scenarios in the Lower Hunter region, Australia. Scenarios were modelled through either adding vegetation (positive orientation) or removing vegetation (negative orientation, development). Results Scenarios that included positive conservation orientation link the isolated eastern and western reaches of the Lower Hunter, even when negative conservation scores were included in the model. This outcome is consistent with proposed connectivity corridors identified in regional strategies. The development scenario showed connectivity patterns similar to only modelling negative conservation orientation scores, with greater fragmentation across the region. Conclusions The modeled outcomes showed consistency between the public's conservation orientation and the ecological rationale for increasing connectivity within the region. If conservation orientation can be translated into conservation initiatives, the result will be enhanced regional landscape connectivity that is both ecologically beneficial, as well as socially acceptable.	10.1007/s10980-015-0153-0	2015

157	Critical GIS emphasized the ways in which social, political, and economic inequalities are (re)produced through spatial information technologies and attendant practices. In the mid-1990s through the early 2000s, feminist interventions challenged the presumed gender neutrality and universality of GIS and brought gender to the fore of Critical GIS concerns. However, the rise of nascent web-based spatial information technologiesor new spatial mediasignals the need to extend this work to determine how it is that gender matters differently in this newly diversified, pervasive, and public context of geographic information technologies. Building on an analysis of online commentaries and an assessment of the functions and promotional material of several illustrative applications, we argue that gender continues to matter vis-a-vis new spatial media in three key dimensions: i) new practices of data creation and curation; ii) affordances of new technologies; and iii) new digital spatial mediations of everyday life.	10.1111/cag.12093	2015
158	In the 20 years that have passed since the fabled Friday Harbor meetings of November 1993, where GIS practitioners and critical human geographers agreed to a cease-fire, the GIS & Society agenda has been reflected upon, pushed forward, and diffracted in few (but intellectually significant) arenas. Critical, participatory, public participation, and feminist GIS have given way more recently to qualitative GIS, GIS and non-representational theory, and the spatial digital humanities. Traveling at the margins of these efforts has been a kind of social history of mapping and GIS. And while GIScience has been conversant and compatible with many of these permutations in the GIS & Society agenda, a social history of mapping and GIS (as signaled most directly by John Pickles in ) has perhaps the least potential for tinkering with GIScience practice (see conversation between Agnieszka Leszczynski and Jeremy Crampton in 2009). Perhaps this disconnect is growing, as can be witnessed in the feverish emergence of a big data analytics/visualization perspective within the contemporary GISciences (alongside the growth of funding paths around cyberinfrastructure). What then is the relevance and role of a social history of GIS for GIScience practice? In this viewpoint, I sketch and reflect upon a diversity of efforts that address this question.	10.1111/cag.12118	2015
159	Binaries, the most reductive form of categorization, can be usefully invoked to characterize emerging phenomena; yet, they are widely critiqued for oversimplifying a complex world and for their use as tools of social and political influence. Through a literature review and content analysis this article traces the emergence of volunteered geographic information (VGI), and identifies the recurrent use of several related binaries to contrast this phenomenon with the conventional spatial data production activities of states and corporations. Using several key examples, these binaries are deconstructed by identifying a mismatch in how VGI is conceptualized (bottom-up, amateur, asserted) in the literature and the reality of existing VGI projects. As an alternative to a binary conceptualization of spatial data production, a different representation is put forward that more accurately depicts what is in actuality a vast, shifting, and heterogeneous landscape of spatial data production approaches. Thinking about contemporary spatial data production not as a binary but as a continuum could encourage the development of hybridities that harness the benefits of different approachesincluding the oversight and quality control of conventional methods, with the speed, low cost, and distributed nature of citizen-based spatial data production.	10.1111/cag.12119	2015
160	The popularity of geotagged social media has provided many research opportunities for geographers and GIScientists in the digital age. This article reviews innovative approaches to studying spatially linked social media, and applies lessons taken from qualitative GIS and geographic visualization to improve these approaches. I introduce the idea of code clouds as a potential technique for the qualitative geovisualization of spatial information. Code clouds can depict and visualize analytic codes, or codes identifying key ideas and themes, that are generated through digital qualitative research. Rather than transforming qualitative forms of data into categories or numbers, code clouds attempt to preserve and represent the context of data as a visualized outcome of qualitative analysis. I use examples from an exploratory case study of geotweets in King County, WA, to demonstrate how code clouds can be applied to the production of meanings through qualitative geovisualization.	10.1111/cag.12133	2015

162	In the current study we investigated the extent to which neighbourhood preferences could be used as a base to group people in order to explore their residential and travel choices. The basic idea of this study was that the preferences people would have for their residential and travel choices might be a robust predictor of their actual travel behaviour, and that the neighbourhood preferences might distinguish people in terms of the characteristics of their living environment. We used a moderation model to test whether the effect of built environment on travel behaviour varied in terms of resident's type. A total of 3403 inhabitants of the city of Tampere in Finland participated in the study. A web-based public participation GIS survey combining the questionnaires with a map (SoftGIS technique) was used to collect the data. We identified two distinct groups of residents in terms of general neighbourhood preferences. The findings showed that clustering residents based on neighbourhood preferences moderated the association between some features of density measures and travel behaviour. We found significant differences between the two clusters in both the frequencies and the distance of pedestrian and bike travel. The findings revealed that inhabitants of neighbourhoods with a larger percentage of green surroundings had a greater perception of neighbourhood stability than did the residents of neighbourhoods with a smaller percentage of green surroundings.

163	The concept of place attachment has been studied extensively across multiple disciplines but only recently with empirical measurement using public participation GIS (PPGIS) and related crowd-sourcing mapping methods. This research trialed a spatially explicit method for identifying place attachment in a regional study in South Australia. Our research objectives were to (1) analyze and present the spatial results of the mapping method as a benchmark for future research, (2) compare mapped place attachment to the more common practice of mapping landscape values in PPGIS that comprise a values home range, (3) identify how participant socio-demographic and home location attributes influence place attachment, (4) provide some guidance for mapping place attachment in future research. We found large spatial variability in individual place attachment and mapped landscape values using both area and distance-based measures. The area of place attachment is influenced by occupational roles such as farming or conservation, as well as home location, especially in coastal versus non-coastal contexts. The spatial distribution of mapped landscape values or values home range is related to, but not identical to mapped place attachment with just over half of landscape values located outside the area of mapped place attachment. Economic livelihood values, as an indicator of place dependence, and social values, as an indicator of place identity, are more likely to be mapped within the place attachment area. Aggregated place attachment across participants in the region showed similar spatial intensity to aggregated values home range, but area-based assessment of place attachment and values home range are distorted by edge effects such as a coastline. To further develop the mapping of place attachment in PPGIS, we identify knowledge gaps from our study and offer suggestions for future research design. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

165	Recent attempts to integrate geographic information systems (GIS) and participatory techniques have given rise to terminologies such as participatory GIS and community-integrated GIS. Little has been published about the usefulness of participatory GIS, especially for purposes of flood risk assessment in Zimbabwe. This paper attempts to address this research gap and demonstrates that when combined with participatory methodologies, GIS can provide a mechanism for assessing flood extend in flood-prone communities of Chadereka in Muzarabani communal lands. Flood risk is increasing in the flood-prone areas in Zimbabwe, especially in remote areas where gauging stations are nonexistent because of lack of hydrometeorological and climate data for these areas, historical and projected flood events cannot be assessed through modelling. The spatial extent of the flood zone of the December 2007 flash flood event that took place in Chadereka area was mapped using participatory geographic information systems (PGIS), as well as the data collected through interviews that were held with key informants and focus group discussions. Using this approach, a flood extend assessment map was drawn by triangulating the resultant 12 PGIS maps produced by the local community. The results of the study suggest that if conventional GIS and flood modelling is cross checked with PGIS and fieldwork results, the spatial characteristics of floods in ungauged flood-prone areas can be improved and enable the profiling of floods in Chadereka ward.	10.1007/s12517-014-1265-6	2015
166	A significant barrier to the use of public participation GIS (PPGIS) and crowd-sourcing for conservation planning is uncertainty about the quality of the spatial data generated. This study examines the quality of PPGIS data for use in conservation planning. We evaluate two dimensions of spatial data quality, positional accuracy and data completeness using empirical PPGIS data from a statewide study of public lands in Victoria, Australia. Using an expert-derived spatial conservation model for Victoria as a benchmark, we quantify the performance of a crowd-sourced public in their capacity to accurately and comprehensively identify areas of high conservation importance in the PPGIS process. About 70% of PPGIS points that identified biological/conservation values were spatially coincident (position accurate) with modeled areas of high conservation importance, with greater accuracy associated with locations in existing protected areas. PPGIS data had less positional accuracy when participants identified biological values in urban areas and on non-public lands in general. The PPGIS process did not comprehensively identify all the largest, contiguous areas of high conservation importance in the state, missing about 20% of areas, primarily on small public land units in less densely populated regions of the state. Preferences for increased conservation/protection were over-represented in areas proximate to the Melbourne urban area and under-represented in more remote statewide locations. Our results indicate that if PPGIS data is to be integrated into spatial models for conservation planning, it is important to account for the spatial accuracy and completeness limitations identified in this study (i.e., urban areas, non-public lands, and smaller remote locations). The spatial accuracy and completeness of PPGIS data in this study suggests spatial data quality may be \\good enough\\" to complement biological data in conservation planning but perhaps not good enough to overcome the mistrust associated with crowd-sourced knowledge. Recommendations to improve PPGIS data quality for prospective conservation planning applications are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."	10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.11.014	2015
167	This article examines the idea of the 'archive city': a spatiotemporal construct oriented around the central metaphor of the 'city as archive'. Surfing the cusp between the material and immaterial, the tangible and intangible, the embodied and virtual, the producer and consumer and - not least - the analogue and the digital, the archive city denotes a conceptualization of 'archival space' that straddles the material and symbolic city and which invites reflection on the ways cultural geographies of memory - in this case those specific to cities and other urban landscapes - are enfolded across the multi-sited and multilayered spaces of everyday urban practice. Reframing the ontological question of 'what is the archive in the digital age?' in terms of 'where is the archive?', in the first part of the article I survey the theoretical precincts of the archive city before moving on to discuss how we might conceive of a digital spatial humanities in which this more open and purposefully elusive conceptualization of the archive can productively inform debates and practices relating to urban cultural memory. The article then discusses two case studies, both of which map the cinematic geographies of cities: Liverpool in the northwest of England and Bologna in Italy. The article ends with some concluding thoughts on the role of digital spatial humanities in urban-based cultural memory studies and the broader theoretical and practical implications this has in relation to digital and 'open' archival practices.	10.1177/1354856514560310	2015
168	Previous research on broadening participation in higher education and Science Technology Engineering and Math has inadequately examined the role of place. This article explores the socio-spatial perceptions of youth of a college campus and changes in perceptions youth experience during their transition from being a university neighbor to becoming part of a university community. This study uses sketch maps and qualitative Geographic Information Systems to document the changing perceptions of 43 youth aged 14-18 during their participation in a university program. The results suggest that some students started to identify with campus spaces as a university student or employee rather than as a neighbor of the university.	10.1080/03098265.2014.1002079	2015
169	As coastlines face increased development pressure, it is important to have the best available spatial information on coastal activities, including commercial fishing. This article describes the creation of a fine-scale spatial representation of lobster fishing activity along the Maine coast of the United States using a combination of participatory geographic information systems (GIS) and dasymetric mapping methods. These methods are employed here to support data collection from a large number of active lobster harvesters while maintaining individual privacy. The resulting representation of the fishery is designed as a planning tool for identifying potential interactions between marine resources and human activities.	10.1080/00330124.2014.883956	2015
170	Open-source and collaborative mapping projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) are designed to support community empowerment and to ensure that high-quality bias-free data are available to everyone regardless of their origin, social status and position within the power structure. In this paper, I will describe the main advantages and disadvantages of the OSM and Google Map Maker for participatory mapping. Second, I will use the example of Koffiekraal village in the North-West province, South Africa, to analyse coverage and data quality of two different data sets. Third, I will discuss a possible community project based on the spatial information gathered through the process of participatory mapping organized in Koffiekraal in the previous projects. Maps were historically used to govern cities, states and nations, to support colonial and army operations and to maintain the superior position of those with power. Participatory mapping and community empowerment are new trends in the development discourse that allow local communities to become part of the power structures and influence what is mapped and what is on the map.	10.1080/03736245.2014.924866	2015
171	We introduce critical reflection mapping as a novel and hybrid research methodology for examining the sociospatial perceptions of researchers in new research settings, particularly international ones. The methodology, theoretically situated within the critical geographic information systems literature, combines two existing research methods (qualitative sketch mapping and critical reflection) to elicit original ways in which researchers can critically reflect on an area new to them while spatially linking these qualitative place-based reflections to sketch maps. The methodology allows for synergistic data sets to inform each other and to be analyzed together rather than separately. Through critical reflection mapping, we demonstrate how multiple data sets and methods are combined so that critical reflection and word clouds add significant intellectual value by making another layer of textual information immediately accessible to qualitative sketch mapping data analysis. We present two case studies in Belize and Panama from our current community geography research agendas to demonstrate the viability as well as the caveats of this novel methodology for understanding and representing the immediate sociospatial perceptions of researchers. In the context of international research experiences discussed in this article, the methodology captures individual responses to features of the built environment including walkability and sustainability; documents the changing emotions a newly immersed researcher has in a largely unfamiliar geographic setting; and connects new experiences in a foreign research setting to an individual's everyday lived experiences, positionality, and multiple identities. It also makes these experiences more visible to fellow researchers in a large research team and thus lends itself as a potential forum for shared reflection.	10.1080/00045608.2014.960041	2015
172	This article explores land-tenure issues faced by Timor-Leste, specifically with reference to customary land, and the significance of mapping in resolving those difficulties. A critical review is undertaken of the pitfalls of Indigenous mapping and applications of Participatory Geographic Information Systems (PGIS) to achieve sensitive and empowering outcomes for customary groups seeking land claims. A methodology for mapping customary land in Timor-Leste is described and an analysis of the author's on-the-ground research is presented. Although the importance of customary institutions for rural land management across Timor-Leste is ascertained, this article does not advance a definitive land rights framework for the country or prescribe national mapping of customary areas. Instead, it argues for a mapping methodology to support land-use decision-making that can make sense of Indigenous knowledge and appropriate cultural practices in rural land-use claims. Identified as crucial in the process is the equal value attributed to evidence presented in myriad forms that may act as key information bridges across epistemological divides and knowledges. PGIS is a potentially important tool for resolving land-use conflicts in rural Timor-Leste when resolution occurs within a formalised institutional framework.	10.1080/00049182.2015.1080344	2015
173	In this paper I trace the origins of \\neogeography\\" (a constellation of new mapping practices and populations on the geospatial web) to its roots in computer hacker culture, notably through early mapping mashups, known originally as \\"map hacks\\". I argue that a return to the figure of the hacker-via the proposed concept of hacker cartography-offers a productive lens for understanding the affordances and limitations of participatory knowledge production on the geoweb. Drawing on theorizations of hacker communities and the \\"hacker ethic\\" in the literature, I explore how hacker politics (and their critiques) can be observed on the geoweb, using specific examples from OpenStreetMap. I argue that the figure of the hacker-a highly expert individual who nonetheless frequently contributes labor without financial compensation, often producing software and data for his or her own use-presents a fresh way to rethink the expert/novice, professional/amateur and producer/consumer axes that have frustrated geographers' theorizations of participation on the geoweb. I show how the utopian ideals of the hacker ethic offer a promising yet problematic answer to the desires of Critical GIS and Participatory GIS to create more empowered users of geospatial technology."

174	Purpose - Availability and access to food is a determinant of obesity. The purpose of this paper is to examine food availability within and outside of post-primary schools in Ireland. Design/methodology/approach - Data on the internal school food environment were collected from 63 post-primary schools using questionnaires. The external school food environment for these 63 schools was assessed by mapping food businesses within 1 km of schools, using a Geographic Information System (GIS). Food businesses were categorised based on type of food sold. Findings - A total of 68.3 per cent of schools had a canteen, 52.5 per cent had a small food shop and 37.1 per cent had a vending machine. A total of 32.7 per cent of schools reported selling chips (French fries) in their canteen while 44.2 per cent of schools reported selling energy-dense nutrient-poor foods in their school shop. Of the schools surveyed, there was an average of 3.89 coffee shops and sandwich bars, 3.65 full service restaurants, 2.60 Asian and other \\ethnic\\" restaurants, 4.03 fast food restaurants, 1.95 supermarkets, 6.71 local shops and 0.73 fruit and vegetable retailers within a 1 km radius of the post-primary schools. Findings are presented by geography (urban/rural), disadvantage (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in School (DEIS)/non DEIS), gender (girls/boys/mixed) and food policy in place at the school (yes/no). Practical implications - These data will facilitate schools working on the framework for Health Promoting Schools in Ireland. Social implications - This work can contribute to current discussions on restricting accessibility to certain foods and food premises for school children. Originality/value - The study explores the internal and external school food environment. GIS have been used to link the external food environment to specific schools thus allowing a comprehensive analysis of the schools' food environment. To the authors knowledge, this is the first time that both environments are explored simultaneously."	10.1108/HE-04-2014-0058	2015
175	In 2005, New Orleans, Louisiana experienced an interruption in its neighborhood life cycle due to Hurricane Katrina. While federal, state and local administrative policies have tried to manage the process of recovery, the non-profit sector has been a key to the recovery. This paper will examine the case study of the Beacon of Hope Resource Centre (BOH) whose ability to collect data, expand citizen engagement and influence policy made a positive impact upon economic development through public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) with the Regional Planning Commission and the Department of Planning and Urban Studies, University of New Orleans. This successful neighbourhood planning model provides an understanding of how PPGIS partnerships can support and encourage community engagement and economic development pre- and post-disaster.	10.1504/IJDMMM.2015.067632	2015
177	Medicinal plants and fungi play important roles in the health of Maliseet people of northern Maine, USA. A critical aspect of exercising choice in health care for this community is the ability to locate and have access to these plants. Habitat suitability modeling is a form of geospatial technology that can enhance health sovereignty by identifying locations in which populations of medicinal plants can be conserved or established. However, use of this technology within indigenous communities has been limited. Focusing on the medicinal plant muskrat root, Acorus americanus (Raf.) Raf., we generate a habitat suitability model for eastern Aroostook County, Maine (1,055,653.659 ha) that also takes community needs into consideration. Drawing on participatory ethnographic data as well as environmental characteristics, our model combines ecological and sociocultural parameters to identify previously unknown populations of A. americanus that are accessible to tribal elders. Our model successfully predicted 95% of A. americanus locations in our field validation data set of similar to 71,000 ha. Results suggest that approximately 0.6% of our study area contains suitable habitat to plant muskrat root that could also meet tribal members' gathering needs for the future. Increasing the number of potential collection sites gives communities options for gathering, thereby enhancing health sovereignty. Broadly, our work suggests that, when done in partnership with communities, different forms of geospatial technology can be beneficial tools for efforts to promote health sovereignty.

178	We present a participatory methodology for mapping and analyzing urban forests and greenspaces with a particular emphasis on identifying the location and intensity of non-native invasive plant species in a 180-acre nature preserve in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The research uses smart phone and tablet data collection techniques with GPS to understand the extent and intensity of non-native invasive species distributions. Inverse Distance Weighted spatial interpolation techniques are used in GIS to analyze the data. Results are field validated and presented in a series of GIS maps. Chinese Privet covered 454,639 m(2) of the mapped area. The species was found in close proximity to many small streams and a major creek. English Ivy occupied the second largest amount of total ground cover, canvassing more than 244,452 m(2). The species was generally found near residential edges of the nature preserve. As a contribution to the Public Participation GIS literature, the methodology presented in this article has practical and methodological implications for GIS and urban researchers and practitioners interested in utilizing participatory methodologies for urban forest and greenspace management, restoration efforts, and non-native invasive species monitoring.

179	It is readily accepted that understanding socio-environmental challenges requires consideration of multiple stakeholder perspectives and knowledge claims. But a largely ignored question is 'how best to analyse those competing perspectives and claims?'. This paper explores the development of one GIS-based methodology - and reports on its application - to understand and map stakeholder knowledge. We find that combining Q-methodology with participatory mapping helps to overcome a significant problem in social engagement: representing the unclear connection between what people say or do and their underlying attitudes, values or beliefs. The paper is based on a reflexive engagement with flood management and natural adaptive capacity in the Scottish-English Borderlands. The paper confirms how such topics can benefit from an appreciation of the wide range of stakeholders' positions, as well as the underlying beliefs informing those positions. Most importantly, we provide an account of our methodology, offering a template for others interested in unpacking complex socio-environmental issues. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

180	This paper develops a political-industrial ecology approach to explore the urban water metabolism of Los Angeles, which sprawls for thousands of miles across the American West. Conventional approaches to quantify urban carbon footprints rely on global, national, or regional averages and focus narrowly on improving the efficiency of flows of resources moving into and out of the city. These approaches tend to \\black box\\" the methodologies that guide the carbon emissions calculus and the social, political, ecological, and economic processes that perpetually reshape nature-society metabolisms. To more fully delineate the water supply metabolism of Los Angeles, this paper combines theory and method from urban political ecology and industrial ecology. Specifically, we infuse spatiality into the traditional life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach by coupling it with GIS. By illustrating how decisions about system boundaries, emissions factors, and other building blocks fundamentally shape the end result, this intervention at once destabilizes and advances the LCA enterprise. Then, using interviews and historical analysis, we provide a critical analysis of how LA's various water supply infrastructures came to be and illustrate how a sustainable transition based on a narrow carbon calculus is problematized by historical circumstances and strategic (and often conflicting) new paradigms to secure water resources. The political-industrial ecology approach offers valuable insights into the spatiality of material metabolisms and the socio-political processes (re)shaping the relations between nature and society.

181	New social and spatial media and other modes of pervasive computing are altering ways of knowing, remembering, and engaging across time and space. This collection explores how the digital, interactive, and collaborative nature of these technologies contributes to transformations in the nature of knowledge and memory. In particular, the contributions focus on theorizing the collective or social subjectivities and impacts of these technologically mediated rememberings. What are the processes and relationships through which shared knowledge and memory can be transmitted and transformed across time and space? How does memory become socially and politically meaningful? The contributing authors consider how new social and spatial technologies transform space/time connections, reconfigure the forms and practices through which collective memory is transmitted or attention is paid, and impact social relations.	10.1177/1474474014556062	2015
243	Landscape values are a type of place value and are identified and mapped using public participation GIS (PPGIS). PPGIS engages nonexperts to identify important spatial information for environmental or natural resource planning. In 1998, we used PPGIS to identify landscape values for the Chugach National Forest (Alaska) plan revision process. In 2012, we conducted a longitudinal study of the same national forest using Internet PPGIS to identify changes in landscape values. The empirical results indicate stability in landscape values both in importance and spatial distribution. However, the use of different PPGIS methods (paper map vs. Internet) in the longitudinal study also introduced challenges in interpreting and explaining the spatial results. We discuss trade-offs in conducting longitudinal PPGIS research using mixed methods. PPGIS appears well suited for public lands planning, and national forest planning in particular, but barriers to use, such as regulatory approval, remain formidable.	10.1080/08941920.2013.840023	2014
182	New web-based architectures and capacities for digital storage have made online social interactions more significant, discursively and materially. Increasingly, these media-centric shifts toward the online and the interactive have enabled for-profit and nonprofit organizations to capture the attention of potential customers and constituents through social and spatial media. In research on the everyday information- and data-practices of community-based organizations, websites and their mobile applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and Pinterest are examined as the emerging media toolset to build sustained connections to funders, constituents, and other members. These technologies and these new pressures around their utilization have made the daily work of nonprofits more complex. As the landscapes of digital media continually shift their interfaces, protocols, and membership settings (including privacy configurations), I suggest that this new normal - persistent change - presents challenges for collective memory and the attention-work of community-based organizations. Taking up and responding to concerns around the implications of digital information technologies on memory and culture, this paper highlights struggles over externalization as significant to the everyday work of collective action.	10.1177/1474474014539249	2015
183	Mapping approaches offer great potential for community-based participatory researchers interested in displaying youth perceptions and advocating for change. We describe a multilayered approach for gaining local knowledge of neighborhood environments that engages youths as co-researchers and active knowledge producers. By integrating geographic information systems with environmental audits, an interactive focus group, and sketch mapping, the approach provides a place-based understanding of physical activity resources from the situated experience of youths. Youths report safety and a lack of recreational resources as inhibiting physical activity. Maps reflecting youth perceptions aid policy makers in making place-based improvements for youth neighborhood environments.	10.1097/FCH.0000000000000050	2015
184	This study present's the design and implementation of a web-based Participatory Geographic Information System (PGIS) framework intended for offshore wind suitability analysis. The PGIS prototype presented here integrates GIS and decision-making tools that are intended to involve different stakeholders and the public for solving complex planning problems and building consensus. Public involvement from the early planning stage of projects with a spatial nature is very important for future legitimacy and acceptance of these projects. Therefore, developing and executing a system that facilitates effective public involvement for resolving contentious issues can help in fostering long-lasting agreements. The prototype here is a distributed and asynchronous PGIS that combines a discussion forum, a mapping tool and a decision tool. The potential strengths and benefits of this PGIS are demonstrated in a hypothetical case study in Lake Erie, northern Ohio. In the hypothetical case study, participants evaluate the importance of three decision alternatives using different evaluation criteria for expressing their individual preferences. The individual preferences are aggregated by Borda Count (BC) method for generating the group solution, which is used for synthesizing the different evaluation aspects such as the importance of criteria, ranking of the decision alternatives and planning issues related to environmental and socio-economic concerns from the participants.

185	Volunteered geographic information (VGI) is geographic information collected by way of crowdsourcing. However, the distinction between VGI as an information product and the processes that create VGI is blurred. Clearly, the environment that influences the creation of VGI is different than the information product itself, yet most literature treats them as one and the same. Thus, this research is motivated by the need to formalize and standardize the systems that support the creation of VGI. To this end, we propose a conceptual framework for VGI systems, the main components of which-project, participants, and technical infrastructure-form an environment conducive to the creation of VGI. Drawing on examples from OpenStreetMap, Ushahidi, and RinkWatch, we illustrate the pragmatic relevance of these components. Applying a system perspective to VGI allows us to better understand the components and functionality needed to effectively create VGI.	10.3390/ijgi3041278	2014
186	It is increasingly common for participatory data to be collected from the public via a PPGIS, in order to gain a greater understanding both of the world around us, and people's experience of it. The place-based thoughts and feelings of an individual do not, however, always fit well with the space-based points and polygons into which they are typically reduced in such a system, which can limit the effectiveness of many traditional PPGIS' for data collection. In order to address this issue, an alternative PPGIS platform is presented, which allows the collection, storage and analysis of spatial data from the public without the requirement to artificially reduce these data to geographic primitives. The 'Spraycan' platform allows participants to create spatial representations on a map using a familiar airbrush-style interface, permitting the creation of vague regions and boundaries that better reflect the places to which they refer. Data are stored within a 'multi-point-and-attribute' data structure whereby each individual 'dot' of 'paint' created using the airbrush is stored as a discrete geographical object, and is joined to all other associated 'dots', as well as a variety of other demographic and contextual data, including free-text data in which the participants may add context to their spray patterns. The flexibility of this data structure provides a wide and extensible variety of analytical choices for the researcher, as is shown here by an example study demonstrating the use of the Spraycan for decision-support, as well as a number of real-world 'in the wild' applications. It is hoped that this work will open up the agenda for alternative PPGIS interfaces, in order to further explore the possibilities associated with the capture and analysis of 'fuzzy' place-based data.

193	Abstract As the role of information and communications technologies (ICTs) grows, governments have seen the Geoweb and Web 2.0 as an opportunity to increase citizen involvement through e-government which provides citizens with the ability to record and share information. 311 services represent citizens' most direct contact with local governments in the form of volunteered geographic information (VGI) empowering citizens with the means of solving community issues. Past studies have examined VGI and e-government use finding patterns of a digital divide with survey data; yet, further research which allows for the visualization of these patterns using citizen-generated data is needed to understand the link between users and the content they create. This paper seeks to explore the relationship between sociodemographic status and 311 service request frequency in three cities within the United States using geographic information systems (GIS) and regression analysis. Results suggest the potential existence of a digital divide and that the demographic profile of a city plays a role in participation in e-government.	10.1080/10630732.2014.942167	2014
187	Sediment budgets are useful in informing catchment management, however the resources and data required to create a sediment budget may be prohibitive, particularly in developing countries. This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach to an investigation of sediment sources and the creation of a first-order sediment budget for a catchment in eastern Indonesia: a data-poor region in the wet-dry tropics with high sediment production rates and a population largely dependent on subsistence agriculture. The approach integrates results from geospatial analysis and key informant interviews and radionuclide tracers. Free software and imagery were used to demonstrate that geospatial analysis can be achieved without high costs. Surface soil erosion rates were mapped using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, and subsoil sediment sources were digitised from high-resolution imagery. Key informant interviews identified additional gully erosion, not detected through spatial analysis. Radionuclide tracers Cs-137, Pb-210((ex)) and Pu-239 were used to determine the relative contributions of surface soil to sediment. The main sediment sources in the Kambaniru catchment were surface soils (31%), channel change (22%), gully erosion (8%), and landslides (1%), with an estimated annual sediment load of 1440000tyr(-1) at the weir. This sediment budget showed subsoils were a major source of sediment, which contradicts assumptions that underpin Indonesian catchment management policies. The geospatial, interview and field methods were effective in identifying, mapping and quantifying subsoil sediment sources, and can readily be applied in areas where data are scarce and technical skills are low. Radionuclide tracers provide essential information but are expensive.	10.1111/geoa.12076	2014
188	Many states and municipalities prohibit registered sex offenders from residing near schools or other places where children gather. Such residence restrictions are employed in order to prevent sex crimes against children by reducing sex offender access to possible victims. Although numerous academic studies suggest that residence restrictions fail to reduce crime rates or are otherwise inappropriate, the potential effectiveness of these policies has not thoroughly been evaluated from a spatial accessibility perspective. This study explores the spatial accessibility of sex offenders to public schools in a city with enforced residence restrictions, St. Louis, Missouri. The goal of the analysis is to examine how accessible schools are to sex offenders with a history of crimes against children or minors. Unlike previous studies, however, accessibility is measured not only near the place of residence but also during expected routine activities that occur away from the home, such as at the work place or during commutes. To accomplish this, methods of time geography are used to measure cumulative sex offender accessibility to schools based on the home and work addresses of registered individuals. Specifically, potential path trees are used to estimate sex offender access to schools given estimated daily travel budgets. The results show that, while few registered offenders in the city live near schools, nearly all are expected to come in close proximity to them either near the work place or during the expected journey to work. In the context of public policy, this suggests that-from a strictly spatial perspective-residence restriction laws are unlikely to achieve their goal of limiting sex offender access to school children.	10.1007/s12061-014-9116-0	2014
189	Recent conservation planning studies have presented approaches for integrating spatially referenced social (SRS) data with a view to improving the feasibility of conservation action. We reviewed the growing conservation literature on SRS data, focusing on elicited or stated preferences derived through social survey methods such as choice experiments and public participation geographic information systems. Elicited SRS data includes the spatial distribution of willingness to sell, willingness to pay, willingness to act, and assessments of social and cultural values. We developed a typology for assessing elicited SRS data uncertainty which describes how social survey uncertainty propagates when projected spatially and the importance of accounting for spatial uncertainty such as scale effects and data quality. These uncertainties will propagate when elicited SRS data is integrated with biophysical data for conservation planning and may have important consequences for assessing the feasibility of conservation actions. To explore this issue further, we conducted a systematic review of the elicited SRS data literature. We found that social survey uncertainty was commonly tested for, but that these uncertainties were ignored when projected spatially. Based on these results we developed a framework which will help researchers and practitioners estimate social survey uncertainty and use these quantitative estimates to systematically address uncertainty within an analysis. This is important when using SRS data in conservation applications because decisions need to be made irrespective of data quality and well characterized uncertainty can be incorporated into decision theoretic approaches. Caracterizacion de la Incertidumbre Espacial cuando se Integran Datos Sociales a la Planeacion de la Conservacion Estudios recientes de la planeacion de la conservacion han presentado estrategias para integrar datos sociales con referencia espacial (SRE) con miras a mejorar la viabilidad de las acciones de conservacion. Revisamos la creciente literatura de conservacion sobre los datos SRE, enfocandonos en las preferencias obtenidas o mencionadas derivadas de metodos de encuestas sociales como los experimentos de opcion y los sistemas de informacion geografica de participacion publica. Los datos SRE obtenidos incluyeron a la distribucion espacial de la disposicion de vender, de pagar, de actuar y evaluaciones de los valores culturales y sociales. Desarrollamos una tipologia para evaluar la incertidumbre de los datos SRE obtenidos, la que describe como la incertidumbre de las encuestas sociales se propaga cuando se proyecta espacialmente y la importancia de responder a la incertidumbre espacial como los efectos de escala y la calidad de datos. Estas incertidumbres se propagaran cuando los datos SRE obtenidos se integren con datos biofisicos para la planeacion de la conservacion y pueden tener consecuencias importantes para evaluar la viabilidad de las acciones de conservacion. Para explorar mas a fondo este tema, llevamos a cabo una revision sistematica de la literatura sobre datos SRE obtenidos. Encontramos que la incertidumbre de encuestas sociales se probaba comunmente, pero que estas incertidumbres se ignoraban al proyectarse espacialmente. Con base en estos resultados desarrollamos un marco de trabajo que ayudara a los investigadores y a los practicantes a estimar la incertidumbre de las encuestas sociales y a usar estos estimados cuantitativos para senalar sistematicamente a la incertidumbre dentro de un analisis. Estos es importante cuando se usan datos SRE en aplicaciones de la conservacion ya que las decisiones deben tomarse sin importar la calidad de los datos y una incertidumbre bien caracterizada puede ser incorporada a las estrategias de decision teorica.

190	Two related approaches to valuing nature have been advanced in past research including the study of ecosystem services and psychological investigations of the factors that shape behavior. Stronger integration of the insights that emerge from these two lines of enquiry can more effectively sustain ecosystems, economies, and human well-being. Drawing on survey data collected from outdoor recreationists on Santa Cruz Island within Channel Islands National Park, U.S., our study blends these two research approaches to examine a range of tangible and intangible values of ecosystem services provided to stakeholders with differing biocentric and anthropocentric worldviews. We used Public Participation Geographic Information System methods to collect survey data and a Social Values for Ecosystem Services mapping application to spatially analyze a range of values assigned to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the park. Our results showed that preferences for the provision of biological diversity, recreation, and scientific-based values of ecosystem services varied across a spatial gradient. We also observed differences that emerged from a comparison between survey subgroups defined by their worldviews. The implications emanating from this investigation aim to support environmental management decision-making in the context of protected areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

191	Greater accessibility to geospatial technologies has led to a surge of spatialized public health research, much of which has focused on food environments. The purpose of this study was to analyze differing spatial measures of exposure to supermarkets and farmers markets among women of reproductive age in eastern North Carolina. Exposure measures were derived using participant-defined neighborhoods, investigator-defined road network neighborhoods, and activity spaces incorporating participants' time space behaviors. Results showed that mean area for participant-defined neighborhoods (0.04 sq miles) was much smaller than 2.0 mile road network neighborhoods (3.11 sq. miles) and activity spaces (26.36 sq. miles), and that activity spaces provided the greatest market exposure. The traditional residential neighborhood concept may not be particularly relevant for all places. Time-space approaches capturing activity space may be more relevant, particularly if integrated with mixed methods strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

192	In this paper, we demonstrate the use of scenario building in the context of contested land use visions. We examine a small coastal community located 20 kms south of Lisbon. In Almada - Trafaria/Costa da Caparica, competing stakeholders such as central government, local government, environmental NGO's and private companies each have competing development visions for the area. These include the development of recreation and leisure facilities, a container terminal and the re-naturalization of unused land. We illustrate the added value of the GIS-ANN tool in steering negotiations between these different visions and the potential of a scenario building web application as a tool for problem solving. The emergence of user-created GIS-based web content in Planning has transformed passive users and consumers of geospatial information into active contributors to the development of spatial visions of the future. It allows stakeholders to gauge alternative future land uses thus making planning and decision-making processes potentially more transparent and democratic. In this paper, we detail a new method that enhances GIS-web-based public participation. We build on a combination of GIS basic capabilities and the data mining methods of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), namely Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) packaged in a friendly (GUI) user interface that runs on the Google Earth platform. Users will be able to articulate different spatial development scenarios for a specific area, to conduct sensitivity analyses for various competing scenarios and to explore causal connections between them.

194	Online participation in political processes has grown in advanced industrial societies like the United States (E. Anduiza, A. Gallego, and M. Cantijoch, \\Online Political Participation in Spain: The Impact of Traditional and Internet Resources,\\" Journal of Information Technology & Politics 7: 4 (2010) 356-368). Experimentation and goal-setting have been done around integrating two-way communication into online GIS portals to advance online participation. Increasingly, web development information technology enables the development of these functions. However, the state of practice has not developed to support such activities. This paper relies on literature and a survey of US geoportals to provide an in-depth overview of the state of practice for such sites, including stated goals and challenges, current applications, and both technical and realized capabilities. This paper then discusses this state of practice through the lens of the development process of a new geoportal for the St Louis region. This discussion yields a response to issues raised in the literature and provides a framework for other groups that are considering development of similar sites."	10.1080/10630732.2014.942168	2014
195	The Heat Energy Assessment Technologies (HEAT) project uses high-resolution airborne thermal imagery, Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA), and a Geoweb environment to allow the residents of Calgary, Alberta, Canada to visualize the amount and location of waste heat leaving their houses, communities, and the city. To ensure the accuracy of these measures, the correct emissivity of roof materials needs to be known. However, roof material information is not readily available in the Canadian public domain. To overcome this challenge, a unique Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) application was developed using Google Street View that engages citizens to classify the roof materials of single dwelling residences in a simple and intuitive manner. Since data credibility, quality, and accuracy are major concerns when using VGI, a private Multiple Listing Services (MLS) dataset was used for cross-verification. From May-November 2013, 1244 volunteers from 85 cities and 14 countries classified 1815 roofs in the study area. Results show (I) a 72% match between the VGI and MLS data; and (II) in the majority of cases, roofs with greater than, or equal to five contributions have the same material defined in both datasets. Additionally, this research meets new challenges to the GEOBIA community to incorporate existing GIS vector data within an object-based workflow and engages the public to provide volunteered information for urban objects from which new geo-intelligence is created in support of urban energy efficiency.	10.3390/rs6109691	2014
196	Crowdsourcing, volunteered geographic information (VGI) and citizens acting as sensors are currently being used in Australia via GeoWeb 2.0 applications for environmental sustainability purposes. This paper situates the origins of these practices, phenomena and concepts within the intersection of Web 2.0 and emerging online and mobile spatial technologies, herein called the GeoWeb 2.0. The significance of these origins is akin to a revolution in the way information is created, curated and distributed, attributed with transformative social impacts. Applications for environmental sustainability have the potential to be similarly transformative or disruptive. However, Web 2.0 is not described or conceptualised consistently within the literature. Australian examples implementing the GeoWeb 2.0 for environmental sustainability are diverse, but the reasons for this are difficult to ascertain. There is little published by the creators of such applications on their decisions, and Australian research is nascent, occurring across a variety of disciplinary approaches. While a substantial research literature emanates from North America and Europe, its transferability to Australia requires careful assessment. This paper contributes to this assessment by providing a review of relevant literature in the context of Australian examples for environmental sustainability.	10.3390/ijgi3031058	2014
197	Collecting spatial information on fisheries catch and effort is essential to understanding the spatial processes of exploited population dynamics and to manage heterogeneously distributed resources and uses. The use of fishers' knowledge through geographical information systems (GISs) is increasingly considered as a promising source of local information on small-scale coastal fisheries. In this paper we describe the first framework for mapping entire small-scale coastal fisheries using fishers' knowledge on catch size and fishing effort. Four mangrove and coral reef fisheries targeting invertebrates or finfish in New Caledonia (southwest Pacific) were mapped following a five-step framework: (i) stratified random sampling of regular fishers; (ii) collection of fishers' knowledge of fishing areas, fishing effort, and catch size through map-based interviews; (iii) data integration into a spatial geodatabase; (iv) statistical extrapolation of fisher data to the fishery scale; and (v) mapping of catch, effort, and catch per unit effort (CPUE) for each fishery using a GIS overlay procedure. We found evidence that fishers' knowledge supplied precise and accurate quantitative and spatial information on catch size, fishing effort and CPUE for entire fisheries. Fisheries maps captured the fine-scale spatial distribution of fishing activities in a variety of ways according to target taxa, gear type, and home ports. Applications include area-based marine conservation planning and fishery monitoring, management, and governance. This integrated framework can be generalized to a large range of data-poor coastal and inland small-scale fisheries.	10.1093/icesjms/fst204	2014
198	Public lands provide a wide range of values ecological, socio-cultural, and economic but systematic methods to assess the social and cultural values of public lands are underdeveloped. In this study, we present a method that uses public participation GIS (PPGIS) to identify and quantify the social and cultural values associated with different types of public land, ranging from national parks and reserves, to multiple-use lands. In 2014, we conducted a PPGIS study to identify public land values in Victoria, Australia. Over 35,000 landscape value and land use preference locations were mapped by study participants (n = 1905). We analyzed the spatial data for association with public land type, IUCN classification, and an agency level management system. We generated social landscape metrics to quantify values by individual public land units based on value abundance, richness, diversity, and the potential for management conflict. We found statistically significant associations between values and public land type, IUCN protected area classification, and management level of protection. The social landscape metrics indicate that the most highly valued public lands (national parks) have the greatest potential for management conflict, but also reveal several less iconic public lands as having high potential for management conflict. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the PPG'S methods in the study and provide suggestions to improve the process for future assessments of social and cultural values associated with public lands.

199	Sustainability of urban transportation and residents' daily mobility is increasingly important for the future of urban regions. In this paper, we present a novel methodology combining mapped survey responses (gathered using public participation GIS) and sophisticated multimodal routing analysis to understand patterns of suburban residents' daily mobility. Our particular focus is on residents' mode choices and their optimality in terms of travel time. We also examine the carbon-intensity of potential mode choice mismatches where a comparatively slower travel mode is chosen for a particular trip. This paper shows how the combination of the two data sources create new possibilities for analysing daily mobility by enabling the comparison of self-reported, geographically referenced mobility patterns and modelled, objectively \\optimal\\" patterns. Our case study results from a rapidly growing metropolitan area, Greater Helsinki in Finland, indicate that people have rather sustainable daily mobility practices. Their daily trips are typically short (median 1.8 km), and non-motorised travel modes are the most popular. Also the share of car travel is significant. While public transport clearly has the lowest modal share, it is frequently used on longer trips to destinations where public transport connections are good (particularly the city centre). In 44% of trips, the respondents choose the fastest travel mode. When a comparatively slower travel mode is chosen, it most often produces less CO2 emissions than the fastest mode. However, particularly on shopping trips the most commonly reported type of trip car driving dominates as the fastest means of transportation. When a slower mode is chosen on a shopping trip, it is typically more carbon-intensive than the fastest mode would have been in that case. The methodology presented here can be used to support local decision making, particularly when daily services and transport infrastructure are planned or reorganised. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

200	This paper critically reviews ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches for food security under climate change, specifically for the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) comprising the Africa, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China Sea (AIMS) region. The focus is on integrating different knowledge forms. An analysis of current EbA approaches for food security is undertaken, alongside a review of methodologies for integrating local and external knowledge. Key gaps and actions for EbA for food security in the AIMS region, and potentially further afield, are identified. The gaps indicate the lack of coherence in AIMS SIDS approaching food security, in terms of policies and actions not reflecting the ecosystem-food-climate nexus, the lack of a regional framework despite similarities amongst the SIDS, and the infrequency with which knowledge integration occurs. To fill these gaps, suggested actions highlight knowledge identification and combination, learning from others and from history, using local champions, and regularly monitoring and evaluating progress. These actions will push forward the EbA agenda through improved development and use of knowledge, better connections amongst the AIMS SIDS and farther afield, and more local-national-regional collaboration.	10.3390/su6095566	2014
201	In 2011 the Home Office released the police.uk website, which provided a high-resolution map of recent crime data for the national extents of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Through this free service, crimes were represented as points plotted on top of a Google map, visible down to a street level of resolution. However, in order to maintain confidentiality and to comply with data disclosure legislation, individual-level crimes were aggregated into points that represented clusters of events that were located over a series of streets. However, with aggregation the representation of crimes as points becomes problematic, engendering spurious precision over where crimes occurred. Given obvious public sensitivity to such information, there are social imperatives for appropriate representation of crime data, and as such, in this paper we present a method of translating the 'point' crime events into a new representational form that is tied to street network geography; presenting these results in an alternate national crime mapping portal http://www.policestreets.co.uk.	10.1111/area.12116	2014
202	Landscape change is driven by a complex combination of physical, ecological and socio-cultural drivers. Because of their inherent complexity, integrative strategies that combine social and environmental data need to be developed in landscape change research, planning and management. This is particularly true for European mountain areas, where landscapes have undergone major changes through human history, tracing back over thousands of years of continuous human intervention. Within this context the purpose of this paper is twofold: to investigate the processes governing landscape change, and to demonstrate the value of an integrative approach to improve the understanding of such changes. In order to test our approach a Mediterranean mountain area in Northeast Spain was selected. As part of the research process, quantitative data of land cover changes were paired with qualitative social assessment based on local inhabitants' perceptions of changes and identification of driving forces. Findings support that the exploration of local perceptions in addition to the quantitative spatial assessment of land cover dynamics enhances the reliability of processes of interpretation and explanation of landscape change and improves the understanding of hidden dynamics and complex driving forces.

203	The consideration of information on social values in conjunction with biological data is critical for achieving both socially acceptable and scientifically defensible conservation planning outcomes. However, the influence of social values on spatial conservation priorities has received limited attention and is poorly understood. We present an approach that incorporates quantitative data on social values for conservation and social preferences for development into spatial conservation planning. We undertook a public participation GIS survey to spatially represent social values and development preferences and used species distribution models for 7 threatened fauna species to represent biological values. These spatially explicit data were simultaneously included in the conservation planning software Zonation to examine how conservation priorities changed with the inclusion of social data. Integrating spatially explicit information about social values and development preferences with biological data produced prioritizations that differed spatially from the solution based on only biological data. However, the integrated solutions protected a similar proportion of the species' distributions, indicating that Zonation effectively combined the biological and social data to produce socially feasible conservation solutions of approximately equivalent biological value. We were able to identify areas of the landscape where synergies and conflicts between different value sets are likely to occur. Identification of these synergies and conflicts will allow decision makers to target communication strategies to specific areas and ensure effective community engagement and positive conservation outcomes.	10.1111/cobi.12257	2014
264	In my second report discussing the state of historical geography, I review some of the ways historical geographers have made use of digital technologies and digital media. I also highlight how digital data, research, and presentation are affecting related humanities disciplines and inspiring their practitioners to engage more fully with geographic concepts of space, place, and cartography. I argue that information technologies and digital media can deepen the place of historical geography in the academy and in the public's eye.	10.1177/0309132512462807	2013
204	The social construction of a land cover map is explored and the implications of this process for the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) as a land management tool are discussed. Different social contexts create different mapping regimes and contribute to different conceptions of area classes. This likely creates challenges for the mapping process, including the consistency and comparability of the final product across time and space. In this study, part of the mapping process for the Norwegian land cover map called AR5 was followed. By seeing map classes as experiential categories, light is shed on the social construction of land cover/use maps. Different administrative units involved in the mapping process have different interpretations of area classes, even if the class definitions are the same. Local administrative units are closely influenced by the realities of local farmers and tend to map land use rather than land cover, even when they are instructed by the national mapping agency to map land cover. Such a difference challenges the comparability and consistency of maps (land cover vs. land use) when they are used in GIS to detect and monitor change. Alternatively, such co-operative map-making can be seen as an opportunity for the sharing and negotiation of power between the different management groups involved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

205	Walking rates to school remain low for U.S. children in large part due to parent concern for child safety. Little research exists that identifies which features of streets and intersection lead parents to feel that walking is unsafe for their children. In this study, parent volunteers conducted an audit of streets and intersections leading to seven elementary schools in a suburban school district. Parents were most likely to feel concern about streets that lacked sidewalks or had sidewalks with obstructions. Wheelchair-accessible routes were seen as appropriate for walking children. Parents expressed concern over safety at intersections, particularly those involving large streets; traffic controls did not mollify their concern. These results support the use of appropriate behavior models for assessing walking choices, highlight the importance of well-maintained sidewalks and age-appropriate crossings for young families, and demonstrate the importance of including the public in street audits.

206	Background: Understanding the social determinants underlying health disparities benefits from a mixed-methods, participatory research approach. Objectives: Photovoice was used in a research project seeking to identify and validate existing data and models used to address socio-spatial determinants of health in at-risk neighborhoods. Methods: High-risk neighborhoods were identified using geospatial models of pre-identified social determinants of health. Students living within these neighborhoods were trained in Photovoice, and asked to take pictures of elements that influence their neighborhood's health and to create narratives explaining the photographs. Results: Students took 300 photographs showing elements that they perceived affected community health. Negative factors included poor pedestrian access, inadequate property maintenance, pollution, and evidence of gangs, criminal activity, and vagrancy. Positive features included public service infrastructure and outdoor recreation. Photovoice data confirmed and contextualized the geospatial models while building community awareness and capacity. Conclusions: Photovoice can be a useful research tool for building community capacity and validating quantitative data describing social determinants of health.	NA	2014
207	Rarely discussed about the Israel-Palestinian conflict is the antagonism that exists between the Palestinian leadership and the refugees. With the advent of the Oslo peace process in the 1990s, the antagonism began to escalate, for the process's key assumption became that the leadership would relinquish the refugees' right to return home so that Israel would be preserved as a majority Jewish state in exchange for the Palestinian leadership's sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Because the refugees' return home would upset the demographic balance of a Jewish-majority state, they have become impossible figures for both Israel and for the Palestinian leadership's political frame, an impossibility that is taken for granted in dominant maps of Palestine/Israel. This article highlights some ways the refugees have refused this erasure by mapping onto the land their historical presence. Taking their use of Google Earth as a case study, it begins by providing background on Google Earth, situating the software's prehistory within Cold War battles for surveillance and control. It then points to some cracks Google Earth's introduction has presented the post-Cold War political scene with: namely, that nation-states are today stumbling to control with whom maps are shared, who can make them, and what they will look like. It then moves on to show how the refugees have taken advantage of the State of Israel's (as well as the Palestinian leadership's) inability to control the map, in the process rendering the geoweb a new battlefield in the conflict. I conclude with an analysis of how cartographically placing Israel's founding and perpetual violence at the fore, as the Palestinian refugees' counter-cartography does, can help to move forward the refugees' demands for justice.

Palabras claveAlgo raramente discutido en el conflicto israeli-palestino es el antagonismo que existe entre la dirigencia palestina y los refugiados. Con la instalacion del proceso de paz de Oslo en los 1990, ese antagonismo se hizo cada vez mas agudo porque la supuesta clave del proceso fue que quienes lo lideraban desecharian el derecho de los refugiados a regresar a su lugar de origen, de modo que Israel seria preservado como estado de mayoria judia a cambio de la soberania de la dirigencia palestina sobre el Banco Oeste y la Franja de Gaza. Debido a que con el regreso a su hogar de los refugiados se romperia el balance demografico de un estado de mayoria judia, aquellos se han convertido en guarismos imposibles tanto para Israel como para el marco politico de la dirigencia palestina, imposibilidad que es sobreentendida en los mapas de dominio de Palestina/Israel. Este articulo destaca algunas de las maneras como los refugiados han rehusado este borron, mapeando sobre el terreno su presencia historica. Tomando el uso que le dan a Google Earth como un caso de estudio, se comienza entregando los antecedentes de Google Earth, situando la prehistoria del software dentro de las batallas de vigilancia y control de la Guerra Fria. Luego se hace referencia a algunos cracks con los que la introduccion de Google Earth ha dotado a la escena politica de la pos-Guerra Fria: o sea, que los estados-nacion estan hoy acudiendo a todos los medios para controlar con quien compartir o no los mapas, quien puede producirlos, y como luciran esos mapas. Luego se procede a mostrar como han sacado ventaja los refugiados de la incapacidad del estado de Israel (lo mismo que la dirigencia palestina) para controlar el mapa, proceso en el cual han convertido la geored en un nuevo campo de batalla del conflicto. Concluyo con un analisis sobre como puede ayudar el hecho de sacar cartograficamente a la palestra la politica de fundaciones de Israel y la violencia perpetua, como lo hace la contra-cartografia de los refugiados palestinos, para sacar avante las demandas por justicia de los refugiados.	10.1080/00045608.2014.892328	2014
208	Geographic information systems (GIS) represent more than a tool for spatial data handling. Qualitative and mixed-methods approaches with GIS value the suite of spatial methods and technologies, while typically showing a marked sensitivity toward issues of subjectivity, knowledge production, exclusion, reflexivity, and power relations. Although recent research in the use of qualitative GIS demonstrates the ways in which spatial representations and analyses can be used as part of critical geographic inquiry, there remain significant opportunities to demonstrate and synthesize the particular affordances of these approaches. Alongside broader developments in public scholarship and the digital humanities, mixed-methods research with GIS is coming of age, as technological innovations are easing access to data and access to visualization and analytical tools for some. The implications of these developments at the level of knowledge construction within community-based, critical research have been underexplored, however. What are the specific affordances of mixed-methods research with GIS? How are mixed-methods knowledges made and worked through community engagement? Here, we trace how qualitative GIS methods uniquely enable multiple narratives to change the ways in which GIS is practiced. To illustrate this process, we present findings from the use of qualitative GIS to study urban gardening in a postindustrial, Midwestern city.

Las aplicaciones de SIG con metodos cualitativos y mixtos valoran la suite de metodos y tecnologias espaciales, al tiempo que muestran tipicamente una marcada sensibilidad hacia cuestiones de subjetividad, produccion de conocimiento, exclusion, reflexion y relaciones de poder.

209	Wild primates face significant challenges associated with locating resources that involve learning through exploration, encoding, and recalling travel routes, orienting to single landmarks or landmark arrays, monitoring food availability, and applying spatial strategies that reduce effort and increase efficiency. These foraging decisions are likely to involve tradeoffs between traveling to nearby or distant feeding sites based on expectations of resource productivity, predation risk, the availability of other nearby feeding sites, and individual requirements associated with nutrient balancing. Socioecological factors that affect primate foraging decisions include feeding competition, intergroup encounters, mate defense, and opportunities for food sharing. The nine research papers in this Special Issue, Primate Spatial Strategies and Cognition, address a series of related questions examining how monkeys, apes, and humans encode, internally represent, and integrate spatial, temporal, and quantity information in efficiently locating and relocating productive feeding sites in both small-scale and large-scale space. The authors use a range of methods and approaches to study wild and captive primates, including computer and mathematical modeling, virtual reality, and detailed examinations of animal movement using GPS and GIS analyses to better understand primate cognitive ecology and species differences in decision-making. We conclude this Introduction by identifying a series of critical questions for future research designed to document species-specific differences in primate spatial cognition. Am. J.

210	Geographers interested in the social and political implications of the geoweb have recently turned their attention to its attendant \\knowledge politics\\". Such work looks at the processes and discrete moments in development that led to certain knowledges being represented and other knowledges remaining invisible. In this paper I build on these conversations by exploring the knowledge politics of digital humanitarianism. Digital humanitarianism, a technological corollary to the geoweb, is the set of social and institutional networks, technologies, and practices that enable large numbers of remote and on-the-ground individuals to collaborate on humanitarian projects. Specifically, in this paper I offer 4 \\"moments of closure\\" when knowledge politics have been negotiated, enacted, and made durable in digital humanitarianism. These moments of closure constellate around the themes of inclusion, categorization, accuracy, and visibility. I then consider the implications of these moments for the kinds of epistemologies digital humanitarianism espouses, and how knowledges come to be represented. I argue that these knowledge politics - the struggles for legitimacy and means of representation - are fluid and contested, yet become more stable when implemented through technology. Through these processes digital humanitarianism, and by extension the geoweb, embodies the social relations that first produced the debates around knowledge representation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

211	Climate change scenarios predict an increase in the frequency of heavy rainfall events in some areas. This will increase runoff and soil erosion, and reduce agricultural productivity, particularly on vulnerable mountainous agricultural lands that is already exhibiting high rates of soil erosion. Haphazard implementation of soil and water conservation (SWC) interventions on scattered fields is inefficient in reducing soil erosion. The objective of this study was to identify areas at high risk of erosion to aid the design and implementation of sustainable SWC using GIS analysis and farmers' participation approach. A 25 m digital elevation model (DEM) was used to derive layers of flow accumulation, slope steepness and land curvature, which were used to derive an erosion-risk (priority) map for the whole watershed. Boundaries of farmers' fields were mapped and verified by the community and each field was classified into high, moderate or low erosion risk. Fields with low flow accumulation (top of hill) and/or steep slope and/or convex slope were assigned high erosion risk and therefore high implementation priority. The study showed that more than 64% of the fields were classified into high erosion risk areas. Accordingly, a community-watershed plan was established, revised and approved by the community. Incentive loans to implement SWC measures were distributed to 100 farmers based on the priorities of their fields. Judged by local farmers and using 16 randomly selected fields, 90% of the targeted areas were correctly identified using the erosion risk map. After two years, the conservation measures had led to marked improvement of soil conservation. The approach is simple and easy to comprehend by the community and provides scientific basis to prioritize the implementation of SWC and to target the most degraded areas, which amplify the impact of these in reducing the vulnerability to land degradation.	10.1007/s11629-013-2827-x	2014
212	In this paper, I review the recent emergence of three groups of data sources and assess some of the opportunities and challenges they pose for the understanding of cities, particularly in the context of the Regional Science and urban research agenda. These are data collected from mobile sensors carried by individuals, data derived from businesses moving their activity online and government data released in an open format. Although very different from each other, they are all becoming available as a side-effect since they were created with different purposes but their degree of popularity, pervasiveness and ease of access is turning them into interesting alternatives for researchers. Existing projects and initiatives that conform to each class are featured as illustrative examples of these new potential sources of knowledge. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

213	Modeling and mapping of cultural ecosystem services (CES) represents a significant gap in ecosystem service research. A GIS-based methodological framework was developed and applied to map agricultural heritage (AH), understood as a non-divisible combination of three cultural services (dimensions, D): the heritage value associated to a culturally significant species (i.e. Chiloe native potato) (D1); the traditional systems of knowledge of AH keepers (D2); and the social relations among them (D3). The final aim of the study was to provide indicators of the \\final\\" service (AH(i), measured in a 0-100 point scale) and its benefits (AH(B), measured in US$/ha), capable to display areas where high value farmland was located. In essence, AH(i) comprised a set of biocultural variables validated and weighted by expert opinion. The experts gave the maximum importance to 5 variables: number of native potato varieties cultivated (D1), use of own seed (D1), form in which cultivation knowledge was acquired by the keeper (D2), exchange of own seed (03), and number of other potato keepers known (D3). In turn, AH(B) reflected society's willingness to pay for the norimaterial benefits of AH conservation. Since these benefits \\"propagate\\" across space extending from local to unknown and distant beneficiaries, and the aim was to identify the most valuable areas for their capacity to satisfy a potential demand,AH(B) was spatialized following the approach of \\"ascribing\\" the potential benefits to their \\"point of provision\\". Thus the highest values of AH(i) coincided with the highest values of AH(B) (US$10.64-8.64 ha(-1)) a comprised 5608 ha of the landscape, and similarly the lowest values of AH(i) matched the lowest values of AH(B) (US$1.69-0.18 ha(-1)) comprising 13,070 ha of the landscape.

214	Collaborative engagement with local residents and organizations is often cited as one of the most valuable aspects of community-based research integration in classroom settings. However, little has been written on the impact of community engagement in international study abroad programs. We explore the use of community geography in Belize to develop international, community-based research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students. In our study abroad program, students utilize Geographic Information Systems, Global Positioning Systems data collection, fieldwork, and interviews to understand social and environmental issues important to our Belizean collaborators. As we demonstrate in this article, foreign collaborators often have different expectations, commitments, burdens, and resources that either encourage or limit their participation in all stages of the research process. These conflicts present researchers and educators with a significant challenge to identify the appropriate model for community engagement that works best in the particular international context. With these challenges in mind, we examine a community geography model for study abroad programs that has implications for geography and related disciplines as scholars work to create meaningful and sustainable international research experiences that benefit higher education students as well as community residents and organizations in host countries.	10.1080/03098265.2014.908351	2014
220	Geographers have argued that the emergence of the geospatial web, or geoweb, represents a radical shift away from the state's monopolization of geospatial technologies. Like the public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) movement before it, the geoweb research agenda has emphasized a desire for empowerment and participatory democracy. However, this research agenda has also inherited a conceptualization of power that emphasizes the linkages between empowerment and public visibility, and this paper argues that this inheritance opens potentially sensitive geoweb data to exploitation. Geographers therefore have an important role to play in emphasizing the need to explore ways of harnessing the power of the geoweb for marginalized communities while nonetheless maintaining those communities' privacy. This paper uses work with the Maijuna indigenous people of Peru as a case study to begin a discussion about how the political goals of disempowered people may be best obtained through both public and private uses of the geoweb.	10.1111/anti.12056	2014
215	Mental and sketch maps have a long tradition in modern geography. Little theoretical and methodological distinction has been made, however, between different hand mapping approaches. Mental maps emerged from behavioral geography of the spatial science tradition as a technique to understand human behaviors based on peoples' perceptions of their spatial environment. More recently, sketch maps have been used in participatory and qualitative geographic information systems (QGIS) to develop cartographies of group and individual spatial narratives. They are a tool that helps achieve QGIS's objectives of collecting unique spatial data of individual experiences, visualizing socio-spatial processes, breaking down particular barriers of positionality in research, and developing new uses of GIS. Two case studies illustrate the use of sketch maps in research, including a project examining job accessibility among working poor individuals and a study of the experiences of fear and safety in public spaces among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community members. Sketch maps in QGIS have many methodological merits. They add an invaluable dimension to the qualitative interview process, offer countermapping perspectives, generate detailed spatial information of individuals, and facilitate data interpretation. ????????????????????????????????, ?????????????????????????????????, ?????????????, ?????????????, ?????????????? (QGIS) ??????????????????????????? QGIS ??????????????????????????????????????, ????GIS????????????????????????????????, ?????????????????, ???????????????????????????????? QGIS ???????????????, ????????????????????????????????????????, ????????? Los mapas mentales y los de esbozo, o boceto cartografico, tienen una larga tradicion en la geografia moderna. No obstante, es muy poca la distincion teorica y metodologica que se ha hecho entre los diferentes enfoques del mapeo manual. Los mapas mentales surgieron en la geografia conductual de la tradicion espacial cientifica como una tecnica para entender las conductas humanas a partir de las percepciones que la gente tiene de su entorno espacial. Mas recientemente, los bocetos cartograficos se han usado en sistemas de informacion geografica cualitativa (SIGC) de tipo participativo, para desarrollar cartografias de narrativas espaciales grupales e individuales. Estas cartografias son una herramienta de apoyo a los objetivos de los SIGC de recolectar datos espaciales unicos a partir de experiencias individuales, visualizando procesos socio-espaciales, echando abajo barreras particulares de posicionalidad en investigacion y desarrollando nuevos usos para los SIG. El uso de las cartografias de boceto en investigacion se ilustra con dos estudios de caso, que incluyen un proyecto para examinar la accesibilidad al trabajo entre trabajadores pobres, y un estudio de las experiencias de temor y seguridad en los espacios publicos entre miembros de las comunidades de lesbianas, gays, bisexuales y transexuales. Los mapas de boceto en los SIGC tienen muchos meritos metodologicos. Ellos agregan una invaluable dimension al proceso de la entrevista cualitativa, ofrecen nuevas perspectivas opuestas a la ortodoxia cartografica, generan informacion espacial detallada de los individuos y facilitan la interpretacion de datos.	10.1080/00330124.2013.781490	2014
216	Detailed maps, appropriate for decision making at the local level are outdated or currently not available in Mozambique. The community map presented in this paper is built on participatory mapping and Participatory GIS practices (especially photo mapping) and links to advanced spatial analysis in the context of disaster risk reduction and flood hazard assessment. Based on a very high-resolution satellite imagery, community members mapped different features such as the community boundary, settlement areas and their names, agricultural areas, important infrastructure and most importantly 'low' and 'high risk' zones for floods. It has been for the first time that a community was mapped in Mozambique in such a way integrating local knowledge. The identification of hazard zones in a participatory manner was seen as one way to overcome the bottleneck of limited available data for a proper GIS-based hazard modeling. Next to the digitization of the community mapped features, an image classification on land use, settlement areas (houses), and the integration of GPS collected points (infrastructure, photos) was carried out. In a final step the map was printed and handed-over to the community members. In the applied methodology it has been demonstrated that the assessment of risks through the integration of community knowledge and paper-based satellite images is valid. Next to the result of deriving a community-based hazard map, the process of mapping is understood as essential to sensitize and learn about local flood hazard risk.	10.1080/17445647.2014.891265	2014
217	Studies of food deserts', neighborhoods in which healthy food is expensive and/or difficult to find, have received much recent political attention. These studies reflect the popularity of a social ecology in public health, rising concerns over an obesity epidemic', and the increasing ease of spatial analysis using geographic information systems (GIS). This paper critically examines these areas, arguing that work on food deserts is a spatialized form of neoliberal paternalism that bounds health problems within low-income communities. Alternative analyses of the urban food landscape, based on work in political ecology and critical GIS, may suggest more equitable paths forward.	10.1177/0309132513484378	2014
218	Malaria elimination remains a major public health challenge in many tropical regions, including large areas of northern South America. In this study, we present a new high spatial resolution (90 x 90 m) risk map for Colombia and surrounding areas based on environmental and human population data. The map was created through a participatory multi-criteria decision analysis in which expert opinion was solicited to determine key environmental and population risk factors, different fuzzy functions to standardize risk factor inputs, and variable factor weights to combine risk factors in a geographic information system. The new risk map was compared to a map of malaria cases in which cases were aggregated to the municipio (municipality) level. The relationship between mean municipio risk scores and total cases by muncipio showed a weak correlation. However, the relationship between pixel-level risk scores and vector occurrence points for two dominant vector species, Anopheles albimanus and Anopheles darlingi, was significantly different (p < 0.05) from a random point distribution, as was a pooled point distribution for these two vector species and Anopheles nuneztovari. Thus, we conclude that the new risk map based on expert opinion provides an accurate spatial representation of risk of potential vector exposure rather than malaria transmission as shown by the pattern of malaria cases, and therefore it may be used to inform public health authorities as to where vector control measures should be prioritized to limit human-vector contact in future malaria outbreaks.

219	Two common approaches for collecting spatial information through public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) include small-group workshops and broader-scale, household sampling. We evaluate the two approaches using empirical PPGIS data for the Chugach National Forest planning process where both approaches were implemented in spring of 2012. Results from a larger PPGIS survey completed in 1998 were also included in the study for comparison. We examined the spatial concurrence of the data generated by the two approaches (workshop versus survey) on multiple spatial attributes (landscape values) using three analytical methods-subsampling, resampling, and hotspot analysis. We found little to weak spatial association from the two participatory mapping methods on most landscape values. These results may be attributed to less spatial data for the workshops and to differences in measurement and sampling between the two approaches. The empirical results of low spatial concurrence raise important questions about the use of workshop participatory GIS for planning decision support. We discuss the implications and supporting rationale for using participatory mapping in community meetings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.01.008	2014
221	This article is based on comparative anthropological fieldwork conducted in the Alpine region of Switzerland on sustainable environmental knowledge about natural hazards related to climate change. It examines ways to complement the normative and technological practices of risk management by using local knowledge to improve the resilience of affected communities against climate-related risks. The study shows how agricultural practices and knowledge may contribute to sustainable behavior towards nature and the environment. It explores how local environmental knowledge, perceptions, and handling strategies of climate-related risks may be integrated within a renewed concept of environmental sustainability. Participatory GIS mapping (PGIS) is the primary research method used. Based on applied visual anthropological methods, PGIS is a cartographical approach that integrates local perceptions and strategies of action drawn from interviews and participant observation. This approach enables improved communication of local knowledge and contributes to interdisciplinary cooperation between different academic fields, such as social anthropology, geography, and civil-engineering in the context of technological risk management. The approach encourages the active participation of local people in the process of sustainable risk management through the integration of cultural meanings and local knowledge about the sustainable management of sensitive natural environments.	10.1007/s13753-014-0013-6	2014
222	The goal of this second report is to review how social media are changing the way we collectively map the world. To reach this goal I review different collective mapping practices that characterize the social media era. First I examine the situation of community mapping in the context of new cartographic processes and technologies, with a focus on indigenous cartographies. I then review the use of volunteers in the production and representation of geospatial knowledge, with an emphasis on crisis mapping. Finally, I discuss how map-making in the social media era reflects major trends in terms of power relationships that occur between the state, its citizens and the private sector. These trends reveal the replacement of the state as the main reference for the collection and dissemination of cartographic data, by a combination of private interest and individually volunteered contributions. Just as the specific interests of the nation state have largely helped to shape the reality produced by paper maps throughout the centuries, this new convergence of interests is now helping to shape the reality produced by digital maps through geosocial media.	10.1177/0309132513514005	2014
223	Land use and cover change (LUCC) is among the most important factors affecting ecosystem services. This study examines the influence of LUCC on recreation and ecotourism opportunities over three decades in southern Chile. An in-depth analysis of the transition matrix was conducted based on Landsat images from 1976, 1985, 1999 and 2007. Main LUCC trajectories were linked to two ecosystem service indicators: (i) Recreation and ecotourism potential, measured in a 0- 100 point scale; and (ii) Recreation and ecotourism opportunities, measured in visitors/ha. A total of 900 trajectories occurred in the landscape between 1976 and 2007. The most important trajectories in terms of area, were the recent degradation of old-growth to secondary forest between 1999 and 2007 (23,290 ha; 13.5 % of landscape), and the early clearing of shrublands for agriculture and pasture land between 1976 and 1985 (7,187 ha, 4.2 % of landscape). In turn, the single most influential trajectory on the magnitude of the indicators was early and permanent degradation of old-growth forest to secondary forest. As a result of these landscape changes, recreation and ecotourism opportunities for the entire landscape were reduced from 65,050 persons in 1976 to 25,038 persons in 1985, further declining to 22,346 and 21,608 persons in 1999 and 2007, respectively. This decrease resulted from changes in specific attributes (i.e. emblematic flora and fauna and forest structure) that were affected by forest degradation and fragmentation. These results highlight the substantial impact of LUCC on recreation opportunity decline, which mirrors biodiversity losses in the study area.	10.1007/s10980-013-9958-x	2014
224	The number of public participation GIS (PPGIS) applications to inform local and regional land, use planning has increased significantly over the last decade. An important rationale for undertaking, participatory mapping is to anticipate and identify areas of potential land use conflict. To date, there, has not been a systematic evaluation of methods for identifying land use conflict potential with PPGIS data. This study uses data from a regional planning study in Australia to describe and evaluate alternative methods for identifying land use conflict potential. A simple, two dimensional model of land use conflict is presented and operationalized with spatial data to provide a heuristic device for regional land-use planning practitioners. Land use conflict is posited to derive from differences in landscape values and land use preferences that can be formulated into different conflict indices and presented in maps. We demonstrate application of the conflict mapping model using residential and industrial development in the region as examples. The spatial distribution of landscape values, values compatibility scoring, land use preference differences, and a combined values and preferences scoring index are all viable methods for identifying and mapping the potential for land use conflict. The preferred method for assessing the potential for land use conflict is one that integrates two dimensions: land use preference directionality (supporting or opposing) and the importance or intensity of landscape values. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each conflict mapping method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.11.007	2014
225	Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic bacterial disease of livestock and wildlife, which has major social and economic costs. In Spain, cattle test-and-slaughter schemes have dramatically reduced TB levels, but a wildlife reservoir of the disease is thought to be preventing total eradication. We aim to identify the risk factors for the presence of TB in cattle in Spain. In this case-control study, we combined a farmer-based questionnaire and participatory mapping with government records in Almodovar, Spain. Data were collected from a mixture of TB-free and TB-infected farms, yielding a total sample of 73 farms. Generalised linear modelling and information theory were used to identify the risk factors strongly associated with TB, and farmers were also asked their opinions on TB and wildlife management. The risk factors most strongly associated with TB on a farm were the presence of wildlife, the number of streams per hectare and feeding volume foods (e.g. hay) on the ground. Farmers' opinions about TB were influenced by their experience of the disease and their interactions with wildlife. The results highlight the complexities of managing TB, and demonstrate the need for a system-level understanding of the inter-relationships among epidemiological, ecological, environmental, social and political risk factors.	10.1007/s10344-013-0757-0	2014
227	Concerns have been raised in numerous countries over declining rates of active transport to school. In a UK context, the pupil-school commute is estimated to contribute around 658kilotonnes of CO2 per year; however, tackling this issue effectively requires an improved understanding of how emissions can be modelled and mapped over a variety of scales. This paper implements a new estimation technique for the modelling of CO2 emissions linked with the school commute that integrates both transport network-level routing and geographically disaggregate vehicle emissions data. The model is then applied to a national cohort of pupils in England. Areas demonstrating the highest emissions were typically more rural and/or comprising more affluent resident populations. Emissions were also shown to increase with school year, with larger step changes between educational stages reflecting the different geography of school locations. Furthermore, where secondary school entry policies were selective or based on a religious domination, average emissions were typically higher than in non-selective schools.	10.1080/13658816.2013.832765	2014
228	Abstract Many indigenous communities are at a crossroads as regards lived experience of traditional livelihoods and members with intimate knowledge of their traditional landscapes. Using case studies from two indigenous communities, this article explores the application of both GIS tools and other geographic multimedia in community-based research projects that document landscape-related knowledge. The study involves a First Nation community in British Columbia, Canada and a Sami community in Finnmark County, Norway. We discuss how land-use traditions and related knowledge constitute a peoples' identity and explore digital means of transferring this knowledge to support the ongoing transfer of indigenous knowledge between geographically dispersed community members, as well as future generations.	10.1080/08003831.2014.904619	2014
229	With the cultural turn in geography, scholars have become more focused on the politics of representation, politics of fieldwork, and politics of the research setting. In human geography, this epistemological shift has been accompanied by a methodological move toward intensive methods at the expense of extensive methods. In this article, I suggest that mixed methods that utilize the strengths of both intensive and extensive methods can offset the weaknesses of each method. Moreover, results from the field suggest that the combination of intensive and extensive methods could produce unique insights only possible from a mixed method approach.	10.1080/00330124.2013.768141	2014
230	The term neogeography, which designates the proliferation of Web-based geographic information technologies and the parallel opening up of the mapping enterprise to nonexpert cartographers, gained traction in 2006. Implicit in the declaration of neogeography, however, is a trivialization of the geographic discipline. Academic geographers, who have never expressed affinity for the label neogeography, have worked to problematize the instrumentalist reductionism of the discipline to data and technics that such a branding presupposes. But as Wilson and Graham (2013b) recently argued, neogeographyor neo, geographyis as much a statement about newness as it is a commentary about the discipline. Geographers' emphasis on the geography part of the neo, geography equation, although warranted, has come at the expense of examining the equally important societal implications of the framing of recent spatial information technologies as always-already new. In this article, I foreground the neo in neo, geography and trace the ways in which the ascribed newness of emergent Web-based spatial media is leveraged in discursive-material practices that enact certain kinds of changes in the world. Drawing on illustrative empirical examples, I demonstrate the ways in which newness (1) acts as a discursive device that depoliticizes spatial media so as to lay the groundwork for their social naturalization; (2) is made recourse to as a means by which certain techno-capitalist actors disavow themselves of responsibility for the societal effects of these technologies; and (3) underwrites the model through which the proliferation and thereby profitability of location-based services is sustained.	10.1080/00045608.2013.846159	2014
231	Direction relations between spatial objects have been a research focus in different fields like spatial reasoning, spatial query, GIS, CAD/CAM, and AI. A novel model named Radial model is proposed to obtain both quantitative and qualitative direction relations based on the principle of the ray transmitting as a straight line. The framework of the proposed model is composed of reference point, reference, and target object. Theoretically, we group direction relations into three cases (case I: point/point; case II: point/line and point/area; case III: line/line, line/area and area/area) for calculation based on point-set theory. Additionally, we employ the model in calculating direction relations on the vector and raster spatial data model in GIS. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	10.1016/j.ijleo.2014.07.097	2014
232	As geospatial information seemingly moves from users' personal computers to 'the cloud', the use of the phrase 'geographic technologies' has increasingly indicated things beyond desktop GIS. With these shifts in the distribution of geospatial data and practices, and the rise of the geoweb as a site of inquiry, new concepts are needed to better understand the conditions of geographic technologies. In this paper I conceptualize one such element of interactivity: connection. Here, I argue that a logic of continuous connectivity underlies the development of digital spatial media and influences the contemporary production of spatial knowledge. For those lives lived that are presumed to be 'always connected', interactions are figured by these connections to digital media. Many of these digital devices (especially mobile ones) become functional only through a series of connections to data and communication networks. For instance, mobile phones are in continuous communication regardless of direct use, 'listening' to cellular towers and analyzing proximity to deliver the best possible connection. From these system-level codes that maintain device connectivity to software-level codes that push and pull data to and from 'the cloud', being always connected is part of a cultural milieu that has diverse implications not only for attention but also for the development of collective, spatial knowledge. Here, I situate the emergence of continuous connectivity in the marketing of handheld computers in the late 1990s, to historicize the importance of connection for understanding geospatial practices.	10.1068/d14112	2014
331	The capability to query the topology of spatial regions is fundamental to today's centralized spatial computing systems, like spatial databases and GIS. By contrast, this paper explores decentralized algorithms for computing the topology of spatial regions in wireless sensor networks. The approach generates global topological information about regions, using only the local knowledge of nodes and their immediate network neighbors aggregated up through spatial boundary structures. Using three basic boundary structures (boundary nodes, boundary cycles, and boundary orientation), a family of decentralized algorithms is defined that can respond efficiently to snapshot queries about the topology of spatial regions, including containment and adjacency queries. The communication complexity of the algorithm is O(n) for realistic inputs. Empirical investigation of the performance of the approach, using simulation, also confirms the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of this approach.	10.1109/TC.2010.177	2011
233	Data warehouses help to store and analyze large multidimensional datasets and provide enterprise decision support. With an increased availability of spatial data in recent years, several new strategies have been proposed to enable their integration into data warehouses and and perform complex OLAP analysis. Cardinal directions have turned out to be very important qualitative spatial relations due to their numerous applications in spatial way finding, GIS, qualitative spatial reasoning and in domains such as cognitive sciences, AI and robotics. They are frequently used as selection and restriction criteria in spatial queries. In data warehouses, cardinal directions can be used to perform spatial OLAP and feature navigation operations. In this article, we introduce and develop the Objects Interaction Graticule (OIG) approach to query the cardinal direction relations among spatio-temporal objects in data warehouses. First, we apply a tiling strategy that determines the zones belonging to the nine cardinal directions of each spatial object at a particular time and intersects them. This leads to a collection of grids over time called the Objects Interaction Graticule (OIG). For each grid cell, the information about the spatial objects that intersect it is stored in a Objects Interaction Matrix. In the second phase, an interpretation method is applied to these matrices to determine the cardinal direction between the moving objects. The results obtained for each valid instant over the objects' lifetime describe the variation in the objects movement over time. Thisis integrated as a spatio-temporalOLAP operation in a novel moving objects data warehouse (MODW) that provides an extensible framework for supporting complex structured objects. Finally, we define new directional predicates that extend MDX querying and leverage OLAP between moving objects.	10.3233/FI-2014-1040	2014
234	Over the last years, geospatial web platforms, social media, and volunteered geographic information (VGI) have opened a window of opportunity for traditional Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) to usher in a new era. Taking advantage of these technological achievements, this paper presents a new approach for a citizen-orientated framework of spatial planning that aims at integrating participatory community work into existing decision-making structures. One major cornerstone of the presented approach is the application of a social geoweb platform (the GeoCitizen platform) that combines geo-web technologies and social media in one single tool allowing citizens to collaboratively report observations, discuss ideas, solve, and monitor problems in their living environment at a local level. This paper gives an account of an ongoing participatory land-zoning process in the Capital District of Quito, Ecuador, where the GeoCitizen platform is applied in a long-term study.	10.1080/15230406.2014.890546	2014
235	How people feel about places matters, especially in their neighborhood. It matters for their health, the health of their children, and their social cohesion and use of local resources. A growing body of research in public health, planning, psychology, and sociology bears out this point. Recently, a new methodological tack has been taken to find out how people feel about places. The sketch map, a once popular tool of behavioral geographers and environmental psychologists to understand how people perceive the structural aspects of places, is now being used in concert with geographic information systems (GIS) to capture and spatially analyze the emotional side of urban environmental perception. This confluence is generating exciting prospects for what we can learn about the characteristics of the urban environment that elicit emotion. However, due to the uncritical way this approach has been employed to date, excitement about the prospects must be tempered by the acknowledgement of its potential problems. In this paper we review the extant research on integrating sketch maps with GIS and then employ a case study of mapping youth fear in Los Angeles gang neighborhoods to demonstrate these prospects and the problems, particularly in the areas of (1) representation of environmental perception in GIS and (2) spatial analysis of these data.	10.1068/b38151	2014
236	Arguably, there have been few shifts in the GISciences so paradigmatic as the emergence of locationally-aware mobile devices. GISc researchers in the US have witnessed these changes in just the last crop of PhD students, with topics on location-based services, the geoweb, volunteered geographic information and neogeography, somewhat eclipsing earlier, trendy topics on web-based GIS and interactive digital cartography. Indeed, there are new important players in GISc, with training in and outside of Geography, with backgrounds as diverse as the engineering/computational sciences and the digital humanities as well as critical human geographies. Mobilities researchers, qualitative GIS scholars, cyberinfrastructural scientists, and social and cultural geographers have configured research programs around the proliferation of locationally-aware devices and the 'big data' that have emerged from them. In this viewpoint, I shall outline these diverse developments and sketch what I argue are the foundational issues that comprise a research agenda with and about geospatial technologies in the location-aware future: technological development, the social life of data, and the everyday practices around mobile digital devices.

237	Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that continues to represent a significant health challenge in many tropical and subtropical regions. At a local scale, dengue prevention and control is a cooperative effort as favorable vector breeding sites may be found across residential, commercial and public spaces within a community. However, many vector control initiatives do not take into account local understanding of dengue risk and how this impacts the actions of residents to prevent dengue by eliminating breeding sources. The objective of this study was to use a participatory mapping approach to identify spatial perceptions of risk to dengue at a community scale. Four mapping groups were formed in two urban Malaysian communities that have experienced high dengue rates, divided into male and female groups to encourage gender equity. Participants were asked to draw a map of areas they associated with dengue and mosquito breeding in their communities, and to describe the important features on the map. Sketch map features were digitized into a GIS to create a georeferenced map of community knowledge, translating the outputs into formats accessible to stakeholders. Community spaces linked to dengue identified in the mapping exercises differed between the two communities, and included green spaces, construction projects, drainage networks and abandoned land areas. The findings indicated that resident perceptions of some vulnerable areas, such as green spaces, differed from the views of local public health staff, and could influence the actions of residents to adequately destroy breeding sites. This highlights the need to understand local knowledge of mosquito breeding in order to enhance co-operative efforts with vector-control workers, and increase the effectiveness of dengue prevention efforts at a local scale in Malaysia.

238	Public participation GIS (PPGIS) methods have progressed over the last decade, but as a rapidly evolving practice and area of research, there are new challenges. To identify the key issues and research priorities in PPGIS, two researchers that have designed and implemented more than 40 empirical studies spanning both environmental and urban applications present their views about the present and future of PPGIS for land use planning and management. This paper is intended to be a synthesis, but not necessarily a consensus of the key issues and research priorities. We have organized the paper into six general key issues and four priority research topics. The key issues are: (1) conceptual and theoretical foundations, (2) the diversity of definitions and approaches to participatory mapping, (3) the spatial attributes measured in participatory mapping, (4) sampling, participation, and data quality, (5) relationships between participatory mapped attributes and physical places, and (6) the integration of PPGIS data into planning decision support. Our top research priorities include: (1) understanding and increasing participation rates, (2) identifying and controlling threats to spatial data quality, (3) improving the \\PP\\" or public participation in PPGIS, and (4) evaluating the effectiveness of PPGIS. Our purpose for presenting a research agenda is to stimulate discourse among PPGIS researchers and practitioners about future research needs and to provide support for the mobilization of resources to undertake future empirical research.

239	Subsistence resources are critical for indigenous communities in the Kotzebue Sound region of NW Alaska. Global sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal erosion are likely to create unfavorable and hazardous conditions for coastal and estuarine settlements. It is unclear how SLR and erosion might affect coastal subsistence resources because of highly complex ecological interactions. This study integrates physical, anthropological, and survey data to assess coastal vulnerability and to identify areas of concern for local and regional planning and environmental protection. This study analyzes and integrates historical and projected physical coastal changes within the Kotzebue Sound region with (1) a coastal vulnerability index (CVI); (2) community-based participatory GIS maps of community subsistence resources; and (3) representative surveys of local communities to determine the importance of each type of resource. The results identify Kivalina and Deering as particularly vulnerable coastal locations among four studied villages. While the CVI is high in these locations, low erosion rates will not likely have any negative impact on fish and caribou-two of the most important subsistence resource species for these communities. Because of the higher number of identified subsistence resource species, Deering is more resilient than Kivalina to any potential negative coastal impacts. This methodology can be useful in other coastal areas where subsistence resources play a major part in people's lives.	10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00001.1	2014
240	Increasing interest in implementing an ecosystem-based management approach has made stakeholder involvement vital and has highlighted the need for an effective participatory framework. In this study we used a participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) framework to collaboratively map the marine resources of the transboundary Grenadine Islands with a broad range of stakeholders from the two sovereign nations. We found the application of PGIS allowed the collective resolution of an appropriate mapping scale and a locally relevant habitat classification scheme that would not only serve the needs of resource managers, but could also be understood by resource users. Furthermore, multi-level stakeholder involvement in the mapping process captured resource use profiles and other fishing-related attributes, gave credibility to local knowledge and ownership of information, and was instrumental in building capacity to access and use the produced information. Lessons learned included the importance of investing considerable time early in the participatory process, which was later rewarded by stakeholder buy-in and led to financial and in-kind support. Furthermore, hosting the information in multiple formats on a project website has resulted in easy access and use by a wide range of stakeholders over a cross-country scale. We believe our experiences will be valuable to other practitioners considering using PGIS, particularly for those working in similar resource-limited, developing nation contexts.	10.1080/08920753.2013.863725	2014
241	Despite widespread recognition that social-value information is needed to inform stakeholders and decision makers regarding trade-offs in environmental management, it too often remains absent from ecosystem service assessments. Although quantitative indicators of social values need to be explicitly accounted for in the decision-making process, they need not be monetary. Ongoing efforts to map such values demonstrate how they can also be made spatially explicit and relatable to underlying ecological information. We originally developed Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES) as a tool to assess, map, and quantify nonmarket values perceived by various groups of ecosystem stakeholders. With SolVES 2.0 we have extended the functionality by integrating SolVES with Maxent maximum entropy modeling software to generate more complete social-value maps from available value and preference survey data and to produce more robust models describing the relationship between social values and ecosystems. The current study has two objectives: (1) evaluate how effectively the value index, a quantitative, nonmonetary social-value indicator calculated by SolVES, reproduces results from more common statistical methods of social-survey data analysis and (2) examine how the spatial results produced by SolVES provide additional information that could be used by managers and stakeholders to better understand more complex relationships among stakeholder values, attitudes, and preferences. To achieve these objectives, we applied SolVES to value and preference survey data collected for three national forests, the Pike and San Isabel in Colorado and the Bridger-Teton and the Shoshone in Wyoming. Value index results were generally consistent with results found through more common statistical analyses of the survey data such as frequency, discriminant function, and correlation analyses. In addition, spatial analysis of the social-value maps produced by SolVES provided information that was useful for explaining relationships between stakeholder values and forest uses. Our results suggest that SolVES can effectively reproduce information derived from traditional statistical analyses while adding spatially explicit, social-value information that can contribute to integrated resource assessment, planning, and management of forests and other ecosystems.

242	Previous urban park research has used self-reported surveys and physical activity logs to examine associations between physical activity and park features, size, and distance to participants' homes. In this study, we used participatory geographic information systems (GIS) methods to explore potential correlates of physical activity and other health benefits in urban parks. Using an internet-based public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) system, study participants identified the spatial locations where they engaged in various types of physical activity and where they received other park benefits environmental, social, and psychological health benefits. Using an urban park typology, we found that different urban park types provide different opportunities for physical activity with linear parks providing the greatest overall physical benefit while other park types provided important non-physical community benefits. Distance to park was not a significant predictor of physical activity but park size was correlated with physical activity and other park benefits. We discuss the strengths and limitations of using PPGIS methods for understanding the benefits of urban park systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

244	In this paper we explore the challenges involved in engaging the full range of stakeholders needed for effective marine resource management in the transboundary Grenadine Islands shared by the small island developing States (SIDS) of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada. The study describes the ways stakeholders were engaged in the development of participatory geographic information systems (PGIS), both in terms of the research approach (process) and the final geodatabase (product); it illustrates how the approach provides a practical means to strengthen aspects of marine governance, particularly in a SIDS context. We found that PGIS can provide a foundation for ecosystem-based transboundary marine governance. The advantages of this approach are two-fold: it provides the fullest possible range of information as input for the management of marine resources and it engages the stakeholders. This engagement takes several forms: capacity to participate in research; ownership of information produced; increased stakeholder understanding; empowerment through access to information; capacity to interact with other stakeholders for information and problem-solving; and competence to participate in actual governance processes. Lastly, we discuss considerations for other practitioners contemplating using PGIS, particularly those working in similar resource-limited SIDS environments.	10.1111/1477-8947.12029	2013
245	In 2006 the Western Cape Education Department (WCED) initialised the Language Transformation Plan (LTP) as a strategy to implement the longstanding national Language in Education Policy (DOE 1997). If serious efforts were to be made to expand the transformation plan to all schools across the province, detailed language related information was needed, on various levels of the institution. There is an established use of geographic information systems (GIS) for planning and policy making in fields more traditionally viewed as geographical. Increased accessibility to computer hardware and on-going efforts to create user-friendly software have paved the way for GIS to enter into disciplines such as sociolinguistics in ways that extend beyond simply mapping the distributions of languages in space. This article explores how mapping language-related variables at school level, using GIS, can support language planning and policy implementation from below, by drawing on concepts such as public participation GIS' (NCGIA 1996) and counter-mapping' (Peluso 1995).	10.1080/10228195.2013.840669	2013
246	Background: While understanding geography's role in healthcare has been an area of research for over 40 years, the application of geography-based analyses to prescription medication use is limited. The body of literature was reviewed to assess the current state of such studies to demonstrate the scale and scope of projects in order to highlight potential research opportunities. Objective: To review systematically how researchers have applied geography-based analyses to medication use data. Methods: Empiric, English language research articles were identified through PubMed and bibliographies. Original research articles were independently reviewed as to the medications or classes studied, data sources, measures of medication exposure, geographic units of analysis, geospatial measures, and statistical approaches. Results: From 145 publications matching key search terms, forty publications met the inclusion criteria. Cardiovascular and psychotropic classes accounted for the largest proportion of studies. Prescription drug claims were the primary source, and medication exposure was frequently captured as period prevalence. Medication exposure was documented across a variety of geopolitical units such as countries, provinces, regions, states, and postal codes. Most results were descriptive and formal statistical modeling capitalizing on geospatial techniques was rare. Conclusion: Despite the extensive research on small area variation analysis in healthcare, there are a limited number of studies that have examined geographic variation in medication use. Clearly, there is opportunity to collaborate with geographers and GIS professionals to harness the power of GIS technologies and to strengthen future medication studies by applying more robust geospatial statistical methods.

247	While local governments have been one of the major user groups of GIS, there is still little research on how GIS development in local government might be intertwined with urban governance, particularly in non-Western contexts. Drawing upon insights from GIS implementation, critical GIS, and governmentality studies, this article seeks to bridge this gap by examining the implications of Chinese urban government GIS practices amidst China's changing urban governance. Through an in-depth case study of Shenzhen, this article analyzes how urban GIS has been transformed from a practice involving internal organizational workflow automation, into a more active dimension of the governance of urban spacesreflected in the expanding practice of geo-coding the urban landscape. Geo-coding here refers to a broadly defined spatial practice of carving and reconstructing a rational urban space. GIS practices have constituted a particular form of geographic rationality that seeks to govern at a distance while simultaneously regulating the urban environment, intersecting with the broader transformations of China's urban governance. These GIS developments have been largely government-centric rather than citizen-centric, yet they provide possibilities for new forms of spatial knowledge production for citizen participation in urban governance.	10.1080/02723638.2013.812389	2013
248	The objective of the current research was to examine the current epidemiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI); to determine the effects of geographic region, co-morbidities, year of injury, injury severity, and demographics on hospital costs, length of stay (LOS), and mortality. All subjects were drawn from the Thomason Reuters MarketScan((R)) database. Statistical methods used included descriptive analysis, bivariate analysis, logistic regression, and the Geographic Information System (GIS) software, ArcMap. We studied 76,313 patients with TBI from 2004 to 2009 (52,721 with commercial insurance and 23,592 with Medicare) from the MarketScan database. As age increased, mortality rate and median LOS increased. The median hospital costs for adults were the highest ($13,000 for ages 18-64) compared with children ($8000 for age 0-14) and elderly persons ($9000 for age 65). The mortality rate for the elderly population has decreased slightly (11.1% in 2004 to 9.9% in 2009 for men, and 7.0% to 6.9% for women); however, their hospital costs have increased significantly ($6899 in 2004 to $11,567 in 2009 for men; $6784 to $9782 for women). Concerning the impact of geography, the western United States (e.g., Washington and California) had lower mortality rates and higher median costs while the southeast United States had the highest mortality and mixed median costs. Both overall mortality and median LOS have remained relatively stable over the years. Hospital cost, however, has increased for the elderly population even after accounting for the inflation. There is significant geographic variation for both mortality and hospital costs.	10.1089/neu.2013.2857	2013
249	Background: While there is no panacea for alleviating campus safety concerns, safety experts agree that one of the key components to an effective campus security plan is monitoring the environment. Despite previous attempts to measure campus safety, quantifying perceptions of fear, safety, and risk remains a challenging issue. Since perceptions of safety and incidents of crime do not necessarily mirror one another, both were utilized in this investigation. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to describe an innovative, mixed methods approach for assessing campus safety at a large, urban campus in the southeast region of the United States. Method: A concurrent triangulation design was implemented to allow investigators the opportunity to collect qualitative and quantitative data simultaneously and integrate results in the interpretation phase. Data were collected from four distinct sources of information. Results: Student focus groups yielded data regarding perceptions of risk, and kernel density analysis was used to identify hot spots of campus crime incidents. Conclusion: While in many cases perceived risk and actual crime incidents were associated, incidents of hot spots of each type occurred independently with such frequency that an overall correlation of the two was not significant. Accordingly, while no significant correlation between perceived risk and crime incidents was confirmed statistically, the geospatial integration of these data suggested three types of safety conditions. Further, the combination of focus group data and spatial analyses provided a more comprehensive and, therefore, more complete understanding of the multifaceted issues related to campus safety.	10.1177/0193841X13509815	2013
250	The management of multiple-use public lands such as national forests in the U.S. is controversial because of the wide range of potential uses and contested public values for these lands. Previous research on national forest values and management preferences examined these relationships non-spatially. The development of public participation GIS (PPGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI) systems provide new opportunities to assess spatial relationships between perceived national forest values and preferred uses. This research used empirical data collected from a PPGIS/VGI study for three national forests in California to examine spatial and non-spatial relationships between place-based forest values and preferred uses. The relationships suggest public participants translated some of their non-spatial forest values and preferences into behavioral choices when mapping place-specific values and preferred uses. The empirical relationships between place-based forest values and uses were generally consistent with previous survey research results. Positive, non-spatial attitudes toward extractive uses of national forests were correlated with participant mapping of economic values and related extractive uses, while nonmaterial forest attitudes were correlated with participant mapping of amenity values and conservation-related uses. Further, spatial preferences for extractive forest uses such as timber harvesting were mapped proximate to economic values, while nonmaterial spatial preferences were mapped proximate to amenity-related forest values. PPGIS offers the potential to translate philosophical and ideology-based national forest preferences into place-specific discourse about forest management activities where public accommodation may be more achievable.

251	Ecosystem-based planning and management have stimulated the need to gather sociocultural values and human uses of land in formats accessible to diverse planners and researchers. Human Ecology Mapping (HEM) approaches offer promising spatial data gathering and analytical tools, while also addressing important questions about human-landscape connections. This article reviews and compares the characteristics of three HEM approaches that are increasingly used in natural resource management contexts, each focused on a particular aspect of human-environmental interactions. These aspects include tenure and resource use (TRU), local ecological knowledge (LEK), and sense of place (SOP). We discuss their origins, provide examples of their use, and identify challenges to their application. Our review serves as a guide for environmental managers, planners, and communities interested in gathering spatial data on aspects of human ecology important in ecosystem-based management and planning, and for scientists designing socioecological research.	10.1007/s10745-013-9573-0	2013
252	Autism prevalence has risen dramatically over the past two decades in California. Although often suggested to have been crucial to the rise of autism, environmental and social contextual drivers of diagnosis have not been extensively examined. Identifying the spatial patterning of autism cases at birth and at diagnosis can help clarify which contextual drivers are affecting autism's rising prevalence. Children with autism not co-morbid with mental retardation served by the California Department of Developmental Services during the period 1992-2005 were matched to California's Birth Master Files. We search for spatial clusters of autism at time of birth and at time of diagnosis using a spatial scan approach that controls for key individual-level risk factors. We then test whether indicators of neighborhood-level diagnostic resources are associated with the diagnostic clusters and assess the extent of clustering by autism symptom severity through a multivariate scan. Finally, we test whether children who move into neighborhoods with higher levels of resources are more likely to receive an autism diagnosis relative to those who do not move with regard to resources. Significant birth and diagnostic clusters of autism are observed independent of key individual-level risk factors. While the clusters overlap, there is a strong positive association between the diagnostic clusters and neighborhood-level diagnostic resources. In addition, children with autism who are higher functioning are more likely to be diagnosed within a cluster than children with autism who are lower functioning. Most importantly, children who move into a neighborhood with more diagnostic resources than their previous residence are more likely to subsequently receive an autism diagnosis than children whose neighborhood resources do not change. We identify birth and diagnostic clusters of autism in California that are independent of individual-level autism risk factors. Our findings implicate a causal relationship between neighborhood-level diagnostic resources and spatial patterns of autism incidence but do not rule out the possibility that environmental toxicants have also contributed to autism risk.

253	New spatial media - the informational artefacts and mediating technologies of the geoweb - represent new opportunities for activist, civic, grassroots, indigenous and other groups to leverage web-based geographic information technologies in their efforts to effect social change. Drawing upon evidence from an inductive analysis of five online initiatives that engage new spatial media in activism and civic engagement, we explore new dimensions of the knowledge politics advanced through new spatial media and the mechanisms through which they emerge. Knowledge politics' refers to the use of particular information content, forms of representation or ways of analysing and manipulating information to try to establish the authority or legitimacy of knowledge claims. The five new spatial media initiatives we analyse here introduce new dimensions to the modes of collecting, validating and representing information, when considered against practices of many activist/civic encounters with other kinds of geographic information technologies, such as GIS. The significance of these practices is not in their (arguable) newness, but rather their role in advancing different epistemological strategies for establishing the legitimacy and authority of knowledge claims. Specifically, these new knowledge politics entail a deployment of geovisual artefacts to structure a visual experience; a prioritisation of individualised interactive/exploratory ways of knowing; hyper-granular, highly immediate, experiential cartographic representations de-coupled from conventional practices of cartographic abstraction; and approaches to asserting credibility through witnessing, peer verification and transparency.	10.1111/j.1475-5661.2012.00543.x	2013
254	Background The NHS has a target of cutting its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Travel comprises 17% of the NHS carbon footprint. This carbon footprint represents the total CO2 emissions caused directly or indirectly by the NHS. Patient journeys have previously been planned largely without regard to the environmental impact. The potential contribution of 'avoidable' journeys in primary care is significant. Aim To investigate the carbon footprint of patients travelling to and from a general practice surgery, the issues involved, and potential solutions for reducing patient travel. Design and setting A mixed methods study in a medium-sized practice in Yorkshire. Method During March 2012, 306 patients completed a travel survey. GIS maps of patients' travel (modes and distances) were produced. Two focus groups (12 clinical and 13 non-clinical staff) were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using a thematic framework approach. Results The majority (61%) of patient journeys to and from the surgery were made by car or taxi; main reasons cited were 'convenience', 'time saving', and 'no alternative' for accessing the surgery. Using distances calculated via ArcGIS, the annual estimated CO2 equivalent carbon emissions for the practice totalled approximately 63 tonnes. Predominant themes from interviews related to issues with systems for booking appointments and repeat prescriptions; alternative travel modes; delivering health care; and solutions to reducing travel. Conclusion The modes and distances of patient travel can be accurately determined and allow appropriate carbon emission calculations for GP practices. Although challenging, there is scope for identifying potential solutions (for example, modifying administration systems and promoting walking) to reduce ` 'avoidable' journeys and cut carbon emissions while maintaining access to health care.	10.3399/bjgp13X671579	2013
255	Qualitative locations describe the locations of spatial objects by relating them to a reference frame with qualitative relations. Existing models concerned with regional partitions are mainly topology-based and do not consider the effects of scale changes on locations. This study develops a direction-based multi-scale qualitative location (DMQL) model to fill this gap. First, a cell partition is defined by extending the borders of the minimum bounding rectangles of the regions in a regional partition. Relating spatial objects to all regions by a set of directions is equal to representing the objects as a set of cells in a cell partition. Second, due to the multiple cell representations of spatial objects and the changes in direction relations across scales, some approaches are presented to derive the direction changes between regions in different frames, between spatial objects and regions, and between spatial objects at different scales. Third, the location and relation consistencies of qualitative locations are evaluated based on the cell representations of spatial objects at multiple scales through a case study. The results indicate that the DMQL model can locate objects more precisely than the topology-based models. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2013.05.005	2013
256	Shape cognition and representation play an important role in spatial analysis because shape contains some characteristics of geographic phenomena that can be mined to discover hidden geographic principles. As a difficult cognition problem, the shape representation problem in GIS field has the properties of abstraction, indetermination and symbolization. How to use a model to represent shape cognition in our mental world and how to use a single number to compute the shape measure are interesting questions. In the image processing domain, there are many shape measure methods, but there are few proposals for corresponding vector data. This study aims to build a polygon shape measure and offers a Fourier transform-based method to compute the degree of shape similarity. The procedure first represents the boundary of the vector polygon shape as a periodic function, which is expanded in a Fourier descriptor series, and then, it obtains a set of coefficients that capture the shape information. Through the experiment on spatial shape match and shape query, the study shows that Fourier transform-based shape identification and template matching is consistent with human cognition.

257	The purpose of this study is to offer new insight into architectural and urban planning in the post-sedentary age. Specifically, we reveal the characteristics of walking in cities with mobile networks. The experiment involved strolling around the old town of Tokyo with 20 participants divided into two groups: (1) Those who could use smartphones and (2) those who could only use printed maps. The participants' behaviors were recorded by GPS data loggers and analyzed by GIS in terms of the following three aspects. First, we estimated the features of walking according to the lengths of time participants collected information and the contents of that information and reached the conclusion that walking within mobile networks was deliberate. Second, we analyzed the efficiency of walking using the redundancy index and concluded that different kinds of behaviors can be confirmed depending on the time available to complete tasks. Third, we explored walking with curiosity in terms of the various types of roads where participants walked and inferred that walking in a mobile network environment reduced anxiety regarding losing one's way and aroused much curiosity.

258	Many communities are challenged with balancing growing demands for energy and residential development with the protection of places having cultural or biological importance. Incorporating the preferences and values of local residents early in decision-making processes through public participation GIS (PPGIS) data may help to limit land use conflicts. We used a PPGIS dataset from three counties in Wyoming to determine 1) if there are spatial relationships among mapped cultural or biological values and preferences for new energy or residential development that indicate compatibility or conflict and 2) if there is evidence of geographic discounting or a not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) pattern associated with development preferences. We found strong overlap, or compatibility, between mapped cultural and biological values and little or no overlap among mapped biological or cultural values and energy development siting preferences. These relationships could identify opportunities for conservation initiatives and inform siting of new developments. Where people live influenced their mapping patterns. Participants mapped perceived positive environmental conditions closer to home than negative conditions, demonstrating geographic discounting. We observed NIMBYism for wind development, as participants mapped wind preferences further from their homes than where development is anticipated. We also observed NIMBYism for residential development, but at a reduced spatial discounting rate compared to wind development. Participants mapped their preferences for oil and gas development further from home than existing or anticipated wells but tended to place them near a large oil and gas field, which may reflect a preference for concentrated development, rather than NIMBYism. We noted distinct preferences for contrasting values in different locations, and this consistency among participants shows that PPGIS datasets have potential to communicate a useful collective vision to inform development siting.

259	Geographic information system (GIS) or Health geography is a geographical identification of the spatial variation of contagion disease and zoonosis risk in certain conditions. Comparing the variation of environmental contamination of Toxocara spp. sands of lawns and public areas through the Geographic Information System. Were investigated 98% of Parana recreational urban areas such as, schools, public parks and squares filled with sand and/or lawn. Samples were analyzed using zinc sulphate solution centrifuge-flotation, density 1.420, and water sedimentation. Maps were developed by ESRI Arc GIS 9.2. Total 77/98 (78,6%) of public spaces shown Toxocara spp. eggs presence. No significant difference was observed (p = 0,9999) between eggs prevalence in sand 44/56 (78,6%), and lawn 33/42 (78,6%), at school (p = 0,6898) and squares (p = 0,0616). Egg contamination prevailed in periphery areas in the sand 20/27 (74%) and lawn 18/21 (86%). However, no significant difference was observed between sand and lawn contamination from schools and parks to central and peripheral areas. Although schools 62/66 (93,9%) presented a higher number of enclosed spaces, did not provide a lower frequency of pollution (p = 0,3327). GIS observed a scattered pattern of zoonosis among schools and public squares sand and lawns, with predominance of contamination in the peripheral areas with presence of dogs/cats.	10.2478/s11686-013-0142-x	2013
260	In many developing countries, political documentation acknowledges the crucial elements of participation and spatiality for effective land use planning. However, operative approaches to spatial data inclusion and representation in participatory land management are often lacking. In this paper, we apply and develop an integrated landscape characterization approach to enhance spatial knowledge generation about the complex human-nature interactions in landscapes in the context of Zanzibar, Tanzania. We apply an integrated landscape conceptualization as a theoretical framework where the expert and local knowledge can meet in spatial context. The characterization is based on combining multiple data sources in GIS, and involves local communities and their local spatial knowledge since the beginning into the process. Focusing on the expected information needs for community forest management, our characterization integrates physical landscape features and retrospective landscape change data with place-specific community knowledge collected through participatory GIS techniques. The characterization is established in a map form consisting of four themes and their synthesis. The characterization maps are designed to support intuitive interpretation, express the inherently uncertain nature of the data, and accompanied by photographs to enhance communication. Visual interpretation of the characterization mediates information about the character of areas and places in the studied local landscape, depicting the role of forest resources as part of the landscape entity. We conclude that landscape characterization applied in GIS is a highly potential tool for participatory land and resource management, where spatial argumentation, stakeholder communication, and empowerment are critical issues.	10.1007/s00267-013-0121-x	2013
261	Objective To examine the role of accessibility, product availability, promotions and social norms promotion, factors contributing to the use of smokeless tobacco (ST) products in a typical low-income community of Mumbai community using Geographic Information System (GIS), observational and interview methodologies and to assess implementation of Cigatettes and other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) legislation. Rationale In India, the third largest producer of tobacco in the world, smokeless tobacco products are used by men, women and children. New forms of highly addictive packaged smokeless tobacco products such as gutkha are inexpensive and rates of use are higher in low-income urban communities. These products are known to increase rates of oral cancer and to affect reproductive health and fetal development. Methods The study used a mixed methods approach combining ethnographic and GIS mapping, observation and key informant interviews. Accessibility was defined as density, clustering and distance of residents and schools to tobacco outlets. Observation and interview data with shop owners and community residents produced an archive of products, information on shop histories and income and normative statements. Results Spatial analysis showed high density of outlets with variations across subcommunities. All residents can reach tobacco outlets within 30-100 feet of their homes. Normative statements from 55 respondents indicate acceptance of men's, women's and children's use, and selling smokeless tobacco is reported to be an important form of income generation for some households. Multilevel tobacco control and prevention strategies including tobacco education, community norms change, licensing and surveillance and alternative income generation strategies are needed to reduce accessibility and availability of smokeless tobacco use.	10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2011-050148	2013
262	Considerable effort has been directed into separate but related research foci the study of ecosystem services and participatory mapping methods. The two research foci intersect in the mapping of place-based values, an operational form of social values for ecosystem services that uses public participation GIS (PPGIS) methods. The social valuation of ecosystem services through participatory mapping offers an alternative valuation approach to economic valuation of ecosystem services. This study analyzes the spatial associations between global land cover which provides a proxy indicator of ecosystem services, and place-based values from 11 PPGIS studies completed in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand that comprise a diverse set of temperate ecoregions. Key findings include: the highest frequencies of social values for ecosystem services were associated with forested land cover; water bodies were highly valuable relative to area occupied; and agricultural land and areas of permanent snow and ice were least valuable. Most land cover classes demonstrated high diversity of social values. The importance of different land cover types varies based on the selected evaluation criteria. Additional research is needed to determine whether economic and social valuation approaches provide complementary, contradictory, or redundant measures of the importance of landscapes for providing ecosystem services.

263	Forest landscape planning analyses all forest aspects (economic, ecological and social) and defines long-term forest management guidelines. Various actors are involved in landscape planning; therefore the analysis needs to take into account goals and targets of the different stakeholders. The participatory process can strongly support the development of a bottom-up forest plan definition when stakeholders are involved throughout the decision-making process. In this way, management guidelines are defined by decision makers and local communities through a shared process. With this approach, Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) is a useful tool to support the decision-making process in forest planning. The aim of the paper is to present a method that matches these requirements by exploiting the potential of GIS. The application of Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) is a useful support to integrate stakeholders' priorities and expectations into forest planning strategies. Furthermore, it represents the starting point to draw up management scenarios by integrating and comparing both technical and social priorities. This paper presents an application of PPGIS in a forest landscape plan in southern Italy (Alto Agri district, Basilicata region).	10.3832/ifor0917-006	2013
265	Researchers have traditionally used participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) projects to inject indigenous voices into the political sphere as they work for various legal rights. Due to their participatory nature, however, these projects can also have complex effects on the emotional and affective well-being of participating communities. This article examines how the authors' participatory research with the Maijuna people of the Peruvian Amazon resulted in many positive, affective, and emotional results outside of the final map product. Although the project was initiated as an attempt to produce a map that the Maijuna could use in pursuit of land rights, methodological choices made by the authors also produced positive emotions in participants, political bonding, and community-wide education. While their importance to the political momentum of marginalized communities cannot be overstated, geographers have yet to fully problematize the relationship between these affective and emotional results and their own methodological choices. This article argues that researchers should begin engaging in more affective and emotional thinking when constructing their research methodologies, to both improve the results of their project and to mitigate potential problems.	10.1080/00045608.2012.707596	2013
266	Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been used by traditional cultures for generations as a means to sustain local fisheries for food security. In more recent decades, MPAs have been used by coastal and ocean managers to protect special areas for a wide range of purposes - protecting threatened or rare species, conserving areas for biological diversity and other ecological functions, setting aside areas for recreation - as well as a fisheries management tool. While the role of an MPA in protecting species or biological diversity is fairly well understood, their role as fisheries management tools is more complex and controversial. This paper provides an overview of the use of MPAs as a fisheries management tool in the United States, drawing on the comprehensive MPA Inventory developed and maintained by the National Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA Center).

267	The question of how ecosystem services can be spatially defined and visualized continues to be challenging, particularly for cultural services such as recreation and ecotourism. This study proposes a methodological framework that combines Geographic Information System and participatory methods (Delphi method and Analytic Hierarchy Process) to map recreation and ecotourism at the municipality level. Attributes selected were singular natural resources, scenic beauty, accessibility, tourism attraction capacity, and tourism use aptitude, which were represented by specific spatial criteria validated and weighted by experts. Two types of indicators were obtained and mapped: i) Recreation and ecotourism potential (REPf) which, based on the selected attributes, measured recreation potential in a 0-100 point scale; and ii) Recreation and ecotourism opportunities (REOi), which adjusting REPf by carrying capacity, measured the visitors per hectare that could sustainably recreate in the study area. The resulting maps were highly consistent with the distribution of areas recognized by the tourism authorities as of interest for recreation development (i.e. areas with emblematic flora and fauna and the presence of public and private protected areas). Overall, the methodology demonstrates an important potential for identifying recreation areas to inform local decision making regarding land use planning. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

268	The aim of this study is to examine the spatial distribution of pedestrian injury collisions and analyse the environmental (social and physical) risk factors in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. More specifically, this study investigates the influence of land use, density, traffic and socio-economic characteristics. This cross sectional study is based on pedestrian injury collision data that were collected by the Municipal Transit Police during 20082009. This research presents an analysis of vehiclepedestrian collisions and their spatial risk determinants using mixed methods that included (1) spatial/geographical information systems (GIS) analysis of pedestrian collision data and (2) ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to explain the density of pedestrian collisions data. In our model, we found a higher probability for pedestrian collisions in census tracts with population and employment density, large concentration of commercial/retail land uses and older people (65 and more). Interventions to alleviate this situation including transportation planning such as decentralisation of municipal transport system, investment in road infrastructure density of traffic lights, pedestrian crossing, road design, improves lane demarcation. Besides, land use planning interventions should be implemented in commercial/retail areas, in particular separating pedestrian and vehicular spaces.	10.1080/17457300.2012.724690	2013
269	Public participation is experiencing increasing recognition as an indispensable component of effective communication and engagement between resource users and managers in natural resource planning and management. To bridge a gap between communication, information and participation, natural resource management agencies have increasingly used the visual capability of spatial decision support tools, such as geographic information systems. Nevertheless, both participation and the use of spatial technologies have been promoted without much consideration of how particular stakeholder groups participate and use existing decision support tools. This paper analyses the current state of public participation and the extent to which spatial data and geographic information tools are used by stakeholder groups to facilitate access to information and to support communication in water quality management on the Great Barrier Reef coast. Data were collected via document analysis, participant observation at stakeholders' meeting, face-to-face interviews and questionnaires. Qualitative data were coded for themes using coding analysis processes, whereas quantitative data from the surveys were analysed using standard exploratory and descriptive statistical techniques. Results reveal that reliance on the natural resource management officer, established networks and personal relationships, and provision of property-scale spatial information are important aspects of a meaningful public participation process.	10.1007/s11852-011-0167-y	2013
317	Emerging out of Web 2.0 there have been almost breath-taking technological advances in the geospatial web spurred on by developments in neogeography and the inter-connectivity provided by published open-source application programming interfaces. In addition, the greater availability of location-intelligent devices, social media technologies and the advent of volunteered geographic information promises to further revolutionize traditionally conceived geospatial technologies and empower a world of spatially aware citizen sensors. Together, these new Web 2.0 geospatial platforms and citizen-generated geotagged media pose significant opportunities and challenges to the traditional geospatial framework of GIS and standards-based spatial databases, and to archaeology. The new Web 2.0 geospatial capabilities enable communities of stakeholders and interest groups to contribute, participate, and draw upon spatial data and mapping services formerly in the domain of expert geospatial and archaeological communities.	10.1080/00438243.2012.736273	2012
270	The use of ecosystem service maps for conservation planning is increasing. However, their potential for measuring the benefits derived from protected areas has rarely been studied. To overcome this, information gap, we organized two expert workshops based on participatory mapping techniques for Donana and Sierra Nevada protected areas. Protected area managers and scientists mapped service provision hotspots, (SPHs), degraded SPHs and service benefiting areas (SBAs). In Donana, SPHs were located inside the protected area and its surroundings, whereas, degraded SPHs were located primarily within the protected areas. In Sierra Nevada, most SPHs and most degraded SPHs were located inside the protected area. SBAs were located in the surrounding territory for both protected areas, especially in the neighboring cities. We also identified the major issues that faced both protected areas and their drivers of change. We found that most problems originated outside the limits of the protected areas and were produced by drivers associated with economic factors and land use changes. We discuss the implications of using ecosystem services maps for protected area management and the effects of the surrounding territory on areas within the protected zone. The results of our study demonstrate the need for a broader territorial planning strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	10.1016/j.ecoser.2012.09.001	2013
271	We are developing a geospatial inventory tool that will guide habitat conservation, restoration and coastal development and benefit several stakeholders who seek mitigation and adaptation strategies to shoreline changes resulting from erosion and sea level rise. The ESRI Geoportal Server, which is a type of web portal used to find and access geospatial information in a central repository, is customized by adding a Geoinventory tool capability that allows any shoreline related data to be searched, displayed and analyzed on a map viewer. Users will be able to select sections of the shoreline and generate statistical reports in the map viewer to allow for comparisons. The tool will also facilitate map-based discussion forums and creation of user groups to encourage citizen participation in decisions regarding shoreline stabilization and restoration, thereby promoting sustainable coastal development.	10.3390/ijgi2020385	2013
272	Although it is known by different names, the qualitative quantitative divide is a common enough description for battles between the general and the unique in the social sciences. Whatever value such an academic discussion might have for the pursuit of theory, the goal of applied social science is different. It is, more generally, to solve particular human problems, not to produce universal or law-like understanding. Insofar as applied geography endeavors to link general processes to specific cases, qualitative approaches are uniquely positioned to make meaning in place, impact policy, and transform everyday life. In this article, we discuss three areas in which qualitative methods connect the spectrum of applied geospatial research: Creation, Confirmation, and Connectivity. We show how the union of qualitative methods and a focus on the specific with different geospatial technologies has led to innovative and exciting ways of understanding and visualizing the multifaceted relationships between spatial phenomena. Indeed, through the thoughtful use of qualitative methods, applied geographers can truly begin to understand the complex interactions occurring all around us between society, environment, and place.

273	The New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) is an early adopter of a place-based approach to implementing regional Conservation Management Strategies (CMS). As a new approach, there are few signposts for guidance. The present DOC process relies on a top-down, deductive approach using expert judgement by agency staff. In this study, we examine an alternative approach that uses inductive, public participation GIS (PPGIS) methods to delineate places of significant conservation value. We compare and evaluate the agency's deductive approach with places identified as significant using PPGIS. We discuss the results and present a proposed hierarchy of places framework for use in future place-based conservation management.	10.1080/09640568.2012.685628	2013
274	Urban consolidation projects aiming to support a more sustainable urban form are among the most controversial issues in urban planning. Although planning professionals have reached a rather consistent consensus on the structural characteristics of sustainable urban form, i.e. urban consolidation or densification policy, these goals are often not shared by inhabitants. The resistance by local residents towards densification is based on the fear of losing the environmental qualities that they appreciate without getting added value. We argue that a planning strategy that is sensitive to the local context and respects the inhabitants' place experiences can help in finding unique solutions and in restraining conflicts. To realize the context sensitive strategy, new kind of location-based information from residents is needed: experiential knowledge that is tightly anchored to specific places. In this study, 3119 respondents from the Helsinki metropolitan area participated in a Web-based survey that helped define the quality factors meaningful to inhabitants. The softGIS method used is an example of public participation GIS that allows the study of inhabitants' location-based experiences. The over 10,000 place experiences gathered were analysed in relation to the home locations of respondents and to the number of urban structural characteristics, including urban density, green structure proportion, and land-use patterns. The findings revealed that although green structure was experientially very valuable, densely built areas were also meaningful for inhabitants, especially in regard to social quality. We conclude that the 'soft', experiential information can be a welcome addition to the other layers of information in evidence-based planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

275	Study of the environmental outcomes of urban densification is a highly context-dependent task. Our study shows that collecting and processing place-based survey data by means of the softGIS method is clearly helpful here. With the map-based internet questionnaire each response remains connected to both the physical environment and the everyday life of the respondent. In our study of the Kuninkaankolmio area (located in the Helsinki metropolitan region) the survey data were combined with urban density variables calculated from register-based data on the existing built environment. The regression analysis indicated that the participants in the survey preferred the same density factors for their future residence as they enjoyed in their current neighbourhood. In the second analysis we related the densities of planned infill developments with the interest respondents had shown in these projects. The results show that new and even quite dense infill developments have been found to be rather attractive, with them often being viewed as interesting supplements to the current urban texture. These findings contribute to the ongoing scientific discussion on the feasibility of densification measures and encourage the Kuninkaankolmio planners to proceed, albeit carefully, with the planned infill developments.	10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/025020	2013
276	The appropriate role of the \\public\\" in the planning and management of national forests in the United States is both statutorily vague and socially dynamic. Should forest management be consistent with public values and preferences for these lands? And, how should \\"consistency\\" be defined and evaluated? In 2012, a public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) study was completed for the Chugach National Forest (CNF) in Alaska (United States) that measured public values and preferences to assist future forest plan revision. Place-based public preferences were assessed for consistency with existing CNF national forest plan (2002) prescriptions and to identify areas of potential conflict over forest management direction. Public use preferences were largely consistent with forest plan prescriptions but with some exceptions. Larger-scale analysis of PPGIS preference data provides more detailed information about potential forest conflict and indicates that large-area forest management prescriptions may be too general to guide place-specific forest planning needs. We discuss the use of PPGIS methods for future forest plans, given the release of a new regulatory planning rule for the USDA Forest Service in 2012."	NA	2013
277	The analysis of space and the use of geographic information systems (GIS) have long been important to natural resource applications. More recently, social scientists have been exploring ways to integrate spatial concepts with social science data related to natural resources for theoretical, practical, and methodological reasons. This trend is particularly evident with research in park and protected area (PPA) management and outdoor recreation. The purpose of this paper is to present an updated review of how space has been incorporated into PPA research, integrate concepts and methods, identify gaps, and propose future directions for research. Overall, this review suggests that the incorporation of spatially-related social science data is advancing the field PPA research in an effective and viable way. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

278	Geographers, planners and public health officials are increasingly interested in working with community partners, organizations, and residents to engage in action oriented research designed to impact positive community change. One growing area of community-based research focuses on geographic examinations of aspects of social service accessibility. In this study, we work with multiple community partners in an urban area to examine the spatial distribution of social service providers. We also identify potential new locations for social service providers that can meet the unmet demands for such services. We utilize a Public Participation GIS framework to create shared community resources and research deliverables for our community partners. The results of our work help local providers, leaders, and community residents to visualize gaps and coverage in social services across urban space; draw attention to additional forces that shape access, i.e. public transportation, walkability, and zoning codes; and confirm the anecdotal evidence of poor accessibility presented by neighborhood leaders and residents. The work has practical and actionable implications for lower income urban communities and methodological implications for the disciplines of geography, public health and planning.

The selection of short essays highlights different experiences of building and sustaining community-university partnerships in a variety of cities as vehicles for enhancing experiential learning in geography, urban studies, and cognate disciplines. The aim is to foster a debate among geographers about the role of community-university partnerships in marginalized urban areas and their potential for advancing reciprocal activities that address community needs while offering new circumstances for university out- reach and teaching.	10.1080/00221341.2012.692702	2013
280	As a tool of public policy making, PPGIS (public participation geographic information system) makes its biggest impact in regard to empowerment. Quite few methods are available for making a complete evaluation of the empowerment. Using the Meinong Yellow Butterfly Valley as a case study, this article analyzes how the processes and outcomes of the PPGIS make an impact on empowerment in terms of three aspects indicated by the questions: \\What is empowered?\\" \\"Who are empowered?\\" and \\"How to empower?\\" The results show that we are able to completely grasp the impact of PPGIS empowerment by analyzing what, who and how aspects simultaneously. They also indicate that PPGIS empowerment involves mutual transfers of knowledge, capabilities and power among all of the stakeholders, which can't simply be given by outsiders.

281	A global network of webcams offers unique viewpoints from tens of thousands of locations. Understanding the geographic context of this imagery is vital in using these cameras for quantitative environmental monitoring or surveillance applications. We derive robust geo-calibration constraints that allow users to geo-register static or pan-tilt-zoom cameras by specifying a few corresponding points, and describe our Web interface suitable for novices. We discuss design decisions that support our scalable, publicly accessible Web service that allows webcam textures to be displayed live on 3D geographic models. Finally, we demonstrate several multimedia applications for geo-calibrated cameras.	10.1145/2422956.2422964	2013
282	Qualitative activity space data, i.e. qualitative data associated with the routine locations and activities of individuals, are recognized as increasingly useful by researchers in the social and health sciences for investigating the influence of environment on human behavior. However, there has been little research on techniques for exploring qualitative activity space data. This research illustrates the theoretical principles of combining qualitative and quantitative data and methodologies within the context of geographic information systems (GIS), using visualization as the means of inquiry. Through the use of a prototype implementation of a visualization system for qualitative activity space data and its application in a case study of urban youth we show how these theoretical methodological principles are realized in applied research. The visualization system uses a variety of visual variables to simultaneously depict multiple qualitative and quantitative attributes of individuals' activity spaces. The visualization is applied to explore the activity spaces of a sample of urban youth participating in a study on the geographic and social contexts of adolescent substance use. Examples demonstrate how the visualization can be used to explore individual activity spaces to generate hypotheses, investigate statistical outliers, and explore activity space patterns among subject subgroups.	10.1080/13658816.2012.678362	2013
283	Two main types of cognitive maps, route-based and coordinate-based, have been proposed to explain how animals navigate through their environments. We examined patterns of feeding and ranging in Weddell's saddleback tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis weddelli) in northern Bolivia to assess which type of cognitive map best explains the tamarins' movement patterns in large-scale space, e.g., when moving between distant and out-of-sight goals. We observed the tamarins for 236 h over the course of 32 d and used a GPS unit to record the location of nighttime sleeping sites and feeding trees and the locations of individuals at 10-min intervals. Based on an evaluation of 109 travel segments of > 20 m in which the monkeys traveled from the tree of one major feeding species to another without stopping to rest, forage for insects, or interact with neighbors, we calculated a circuity index (actual distance traveled divided by the straight-line distance) of 1.43. We also plotted the monkeys' daily movement patterns using GIS software. These analyses showed that tamarin travel was not random, that a limited set of route segments (N = 29) was reused on multiple occasions, and that certain areas of the forest appeared to serve as switch points (N = 9) where the monkeys reoriented travel. These results support the contention that the tamarins encoded the spatial relationships among many feeding and sleeping sites in their home range, and navigated in large-scale space using a route-based spatial representation. These results are consistent with those reported for a variety of primate taxa, suggesting that many primate species reuse a familiar set of travel routes and switch points to orient in large-scale space.	10.1007/s10764-012-9644-x	2013
284	This report focuses on the growing interest in the relationship between maps, narratives and meta-narratives. Following a brief historical contextualization of these relationships, this report explores their current state in the Geoweb era. Using the distinction between story maps and grid maps as an analytical framework, I review emerging issues around the extensive use of technologies and online mapping services (i.e. Google maps) to convey stories and to produce new ones. Drawing on literature in film studies, literary studies, visual arts, computer science and communication, I also emphasize the emergence of new forms of spatial expressions interested in providing different perspectives about places and about stories associated to places. In sum, I argue that mapping both vernacular knowledge and fiction is central to understanding places in depth.	10.1177/0309132511423796	2013
285	On the basis of the principle of sustainable development, land-use planning often requires a compromise between economic development and environmental conservation with social justice advocated. Given that values, perceptions, and ideas vary among stakeholders, land-use planning often involves a variety of conflicts with advocating public participation. In this paper we focus on extending the decision-support capabilities of public participation GIS (PPGIS) to facilitate conflict resolution. In the proposed model, conflicts are designated to be investigated and resolved from two levels, namely the value level and the specifics level. From the value level, a consensus-building process is proposed to help participants promote mutual understanding and achieve group agreement. At the specifics level, participants are asked to search for compromise space through discussions over particular concerns. The ultimate goal of the model is to help participants to work out the most acceptable land-use plan. Moreover, a PPGIS prototype with the conflict-resolution model was designed and implemented in the context of Lantau Island, Hong Kong. The study could contribute to PPGIS research and land-use planning by developing the methodology of conflict resolution. The challenges that we encountered and some future directions are also covered in the paper.	10.1068/b37033	2013
286	This paper describes and explains an interdisciplinary and mixed-method approach to a large-scale sustainable tourism development project. The research took place in a two-county area straddling the Blue Ridge Parkway in the Appalachian mountains of Virginia, USA. It was commissioned in order to develop a sustainable tourism centerpiece to enhance the region and encourage visitor expenditures while maintaining the environment and quality of life of the community. In response to Hollinshead and Jamal's 2007 call for a more bricoleur and third ear approach to tourism research, a gap analysis of the region's tourism offerings was performed using six interdisciplinary, mixed-method research phases seeking to identify discrepancies between the current region's tourism offerings, visitor preferences and community stakeholders. Phases included a Community Resource Assessment (GIS-based Inventory), Stakeholder Interviews, a Visitor Survey and GPS visitor tracking, the development of seven Potential Scenarios, a Potential Visitor Survey and an Economic Analysis. Subsequently, two potential tourism centerpieces were developed with the goal of showcasing the region's unique mountain and agricultural heritage. In addition to providing a detailed overview of the research project, the paper concludes with discussion of the practical and political challenges, time constraints and rewards that accompany this type of research.	10.1080/09669582.2012.709862	2013

288	The emergence and proliferation of neogeographic practices since the mid-2000s have drawn significant attention from GIS scholars. I seek to contribute to the discussion on situating neogeography, particularly through examining the performative dimension of neogeography. To understand performative neogeographic practices I enroll de Certeau's notion of tactics to read these practices as tactical spatial narratives, which may provide different possibilities for spaces of civic engagement and political intervention in an increasingly networked and yet individualized society. I also draw upon theoretical insights from critical GIS and critical social theory to situate and trace the constructions of performative neogeographic practices within particular sociopolitical contexts. Through this synthesized framework, I discuss a case study involved in a participatory art performance project entitled \\Everyone's East Lake\\" in China. Drawing upon interviews and document analysis, the author examines how participants utilize neogeographic mapping as a form of performance and tactical act in response to the dominant corporate and state power. While performative mapping has long been used by artists and cartographers, this case study illustrates how these performative neogeographic practices might highlight different intersections between self-identities, community participation, and sociopolitical conditions, through reconfigurations of mobile and networked mapping technologies. These dynamic, hybrid, and networked mapping practices necessitate a broader conceptualization of activism through mapping in critical GIS research."	10.1068/a45161	2013
289	Within the academic and popular discussion of neogeography, it is routinely argued that the process of producing and using geographical information has been fundamentally democratised. Neogeography, in contrast to 'established geography', especially uses the argument that it is for anyone, anywhere, and anytime. Similar arguments have been used to praise the growth in Web GIS since the mid-1990s and seem to be persistent in the conceptualisation of these technologies. However, what is the nature of this democracy, and to what extent do the technologies that are used in neogeography fulfil this democratisation promise? In this contribution the framework offered by Andrew Feenberg in his critical theory of technology, and especially his call for 'deep democratisation', is used to provide a critique of these assertions of the nature of neogeography. The analysis shows that, unlike early critical GIS and the literature on participatory GIS, the analysis of neogeography adopted an instrumentalist interpretation of the technology and its applications. This view claims that technology is value free and that there is a separation between means and ends. This type of argument ignores and disguises the values that are integrated inexorably in advanced technologies. Once the values are exposed and discussed, neogeography becomes far less exciting and transformative. It becomes clear that there is a separation between a technological elite and a wider group of uninformed, labouring participants who are not empowered through the use of the technology. There are also multiple obstacles that limit the democratic potential of neogeography. The analysis progresses by considering the hierarchy of hacking, understood here as the ability to alter and change the meaning and use of a specific technological system. This hierarchy further explains the democratisation potentialities and limits of neogeography. Because of the reduced barriers, neogeography does offer some increased level of democratisation but, to fulfil this potential, it requires careful implementation that takes into account social and political aspects.	10.1068/a45184	2013
290	This paper presents a method for identifying and monitoring regional tourism development preferences using an Internet public participation geographic information system (PPGIS). In 2004, a large baseline study of landscape values and development preferences was completed on Kangaroo Island (KI), South Australia, using low technology, paper-map PPGIS. In 2010, we implemented an Internet-based PPGIS monitoring study with the same participants to (1) determine the efficacy of smaller scale monitoring efforts using an Internet-based PPGIS, (2) examine whether residents' tourism development preferences had changed over the last six years and (3) assess the strengths and weaknesses of the PPGIS methodology for identifying changes in tourism development preferences. Since KI is the first international tourism destination to adopt the Tourism Optimization Management Model (TOMM) for monitoring tourism outcomes, we contrast the PPGIS monitoring method with information from the TOMM process. Our results indicate that tourism development preferences remained relatively stable over the past six years with some small changes on the western reach of the island. We argue that an Internet-based PPGIS method can be an effective tool for tourism development planning and monitoring because the method is place-based, cost-effective and provides tighter coupling with land use planning controls such as zoning.	10.1080/09669582.2012.693501	2013
291	New map-based online tools have the potential to facilitate citizen participation in discussing the impacts of tourism. This research investigates the use of GeospatialWeb 2.0 (Geoweb) tools to gather volunteered geographic information (VGI) on tourism-related environmental change from citizens of Barbados. We hosted participatory mapping workshops where groups of Barbadians directly contributed content to a series of online maps. These maps were made with the free Google My Map tool, allowing users to interact with detailed satellite imagery of Barbados. Qualitative observations were added and geo-referenced to these maps identifying several types of environmental change concerns, both those generated by tourism, and those with implications for tourism development. We analysed how participants used Google My Maps, identifying concerns of accuracy, data completeness and digital/computer literacy amongst users that could affect further use of this tool. Overall, the Geoweb approach provided participants with a unique perspective on environmental change that facilitated deeper discussion of issues and produced a publicly available, spatially referenced record of citizen concerns. Further research needs are demonstrated, including user interface design, accuracy and uncertainty, and how to manage varying levels of digital literacy.	10.1080/09669582.2012.699059	2013
292	Human values are embedded in forest management decisions but are rarely systematically and explicitly included in the decision process. National legislation for public lands often provides conflicting goals but little guidance for agencies such as the U. S. Forest Service to operationalize public value preferences. The historical difficulty of integrating public values into forest management decisions includes the problems of measurement, aggregation, and tradeoff analysis. In this paper, we present a method for measuring and integrating spatially-explicit public values collected using public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) into a decision support framework we call values compatibility analysis (VCA). We provide a case study to demonstrate how spatially-explicit public values can be used to determine the compatibility of designating ATV/OHV routes on national forest land. The applications and limitations of VCA for decision support are elaborated and we conclude that an effective decision support framework should provide some degree of standardization, be broadly inclusive, and provide the opportunity to engage in systematic place-based value trade-off analyses.	10.1007/s12061-011-9072-x	2012
293	This paper reviews research which has investigated community skills for carbon (and other natural resource) monitoring. The assessment focuses on the reliability of the data, the cost of community monitoring (CM) versus expert surveys, and the broader benefits and challenges of involving communities in the process. We identify the tasks considered necessary for carbon monitoring inventories. The review finds that CM is useful and cost-effective for REDD+ carbon monitoring. In particular, forest inventories communities can provide forest enhancement data unobtainable by other means at the scale required. CM is particularly helpful in assessing rates of forest degradation, and would density a national forest inventory in community management areas. We conclude that communities can assess above ground biomass, monitor social and environmental variables, and store and transmit the data.	10.1016/j.cosust.2012.10.008	2012

318	There has, historically, been considerable uncertainty over the meaning of 'urban nature' and, therefore, the extent to which culture and nature are bound in the urban setting. We explore, in this paper, the spatiality of everyday nature as experienced by youth in an urban setting. To do so, we draw on the results of a participatory mapping activity that was designed to elicit information about where youth felt most connected to nature while in the city. Using sketch-map survey instruments, we collected hand-drawn responses from forty-three high school students in the downtown core of Tacoma, Washington. Data were digitized and analyzed in a GIS, and results were revealing of the contingency of the 'nature' concept in urban space as well as the centrality of 'loose' space to urban experiences that are evocative of being in nature.	10.1080/14649365.2012.735690	2012

295	The human perception and valuation of landscapes is a complex process but has been pragmatically advanced through public participation GIS (PPGIS). PPGIS methods have the capacity to generate spatial data to empirically examine relationships between human landscape values and physical landscape character. In 2011, PPGIS methods were used to identify a range of social landscape values for two regions in southern New Zealand, Otago and Southland. Seven of these landscape values were analysed to identify significant relationships with physical landscape character from the New Zealand Landscape Classification system. In this paper we examine methods to extrapolate landscape values from this regional data set to a national level using these landscape value and character relationships. In the absence of empirical value data at a national level, we examine two quantitative approaches for extrapolating landscape values: (1) landscape component weights based on the percentage of value counts found within landscape components, and (2) landscape component weights based on the ratio of landscape values to the landscape area. We prepare and present maps of seven landscape values for the entire country of New Zealand to demonstrate the method. We conclude that landscape value extrapolation can assist impact assessment for land use change but should be kept simple for decision support. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

296	The production and consumption of geographic information is becoming a more mobile practice, with more corporate actors challenging the traditional stronghold of Esri- and government-based geospatial developments. What can be considered a geographic information system has expanded to include web-based technologies like Google Earth/Maps, as well as more recent developments of Microsoft's Bing Maps and the mobile version of ArcGIS available for the iPhone. In addition to these developments, a discursive shift toward 'location' is occurring across the Internet industry. Location has become the new buzzword for social-spatial strategies to target consumers. As reported in 2010, venture capitalists have, since 2009, invested $115 million into location start-ups' - software companies that provide location-based services to mobile computing consumers (Miller and Wortham, 2010). Applications like Foursquare, Loopt, Gowalla, and most recently, Facebook Places allow users to 'check-in' at restaurants, bars, gyms, retail outlets, and offices, thereby sharing their location within their social network. These developments enable consumers to (re)discover their proximities to products, while feeding a desire for making known one's everyday movements. Here. I discuss the development of location-based services as the proliferation of a peculiar form of geographic information: conspicuous mobility. Through discussion of a recent gathering of location-aware software professionals and through analysis of discourses that emerge over a battle between 'check in' companies. I sketch an area of study that explores the implications of these emerging geographic information 'systems', and new everyday cartographers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

297	Understanding the spatial. dimension of fear of crime in the urban environment is important to understanding behaviors in response to this concern. Making this connection between perception and action has long been a goal of scholars in the social and health sciences, though this complex relationship has yet to be fully elucidated. Specifically, in studies on fear of crime and its influence on behavior, a variety of definitions and methods have been employed. This situation has yielded insights, as well as inconsistencies. In the past decade, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has been added to this methodological mix, though it too has contributed limited understanding of the environmental perception-behavior nexus. During this time, sonic scholars have integrated a traditional technique for accessing environmental perception, the sketch map, with this newer technology. This article provides a review and critical assessment: of the way GIS has been used to understand fear of crime, specifically through the integration of sketch maps. This focus is framed by an overview of substantive and methodological concerns and concludes with a discussion of continued research needs. As behavioral responses to fear of crime are acknowledged to impact physical and mental health and overall well-being, in addition to the viability of neighborhoods, research in this area will continue apace. However, for integration of sketch maps in GIS to be a valuable methodological contributor to this line of inquiry, users of the approach must understand its complexities. This article outlines these issues so that they may be considered in future research and may improve the ability for this approach to yield new understanding of fear of crime.	10.1559/15230406394175	2012
298	Site-specific agriculture has been adopted in a high-tech context using, for instance, in situ sensors, satellite images for remote sensing analysis, and some other technological devices. However, farmers and smallholders without the economic resources and required knowledge to use and to access the latest technology seem to find an impediment to precision agricultural practices. This article discusses the possibility of adopting precision agriculture (PA) principles for site-specific management but in a low technology context for such farmers. The proposed methodology to support PA combines low technology dependency and a participatory approach by involving smallholders, farmers and experts. The case studies demonstrate how the interplay of low technology and a participative approach may be suitable for smallholders for site-specific agriculture analysis.	10.1007/s11119-012-9267-4	2012
299	Among the main effects of human activities on the environment are land use and resulting land cover changes. Such changes impact the capacity of ecosystems to provide goods and services to the human society. This supply of multiple goods and services by nature should match the demands of the society, if self-sustaining human-environmental systems and a sustainable utilization of natural capital are to be achieved. To describe respective states and dynamics, appropriate indicators and data for their quantification, including quantitative and qualitative assessments, are needed. By linking land cover information from, e.g. remote sensing, land survey and GIS with data from monitoring, statistics, modeling or interviews, ecosystem service supply and demand can be assessed and transferred to different spatial and temporal scales. The results reveal patterns of human activities over time and space as well as the capacities of different ecosystems to provide ecosystem services under changing land use. Also the locations of respective demands for these services can be determined. As maps are powerful tools, they hold high potentials for visualization of complex phenomena. We present an easy-to-apply concept based on a matrix linking spatially explicit biophysical landscape units to ecological integrity, ecosystem service supply and demand. An exemplary application for energy supply and demand in a central German case study region and respective maps for the years 1990 and 2007 are presented. Based on these data, the concept for an appropriate quantification and related spatial visualization of ecosystem service supply and demand is elaborated and discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

300	Human attribution of multiple values to landscapes is not well understood owing to the variability and complexity of both the landscape concept and the human valuation process. In this study, we extend psychophysical analysis of landscapes by examining the relationships between multiple landscape values and physical landscape character. Previous landscape research has tended to focus on the relationship between a single value such as landscape aesthetics and a single physical landscape component, such as vegetation or water. We spatially intersected eight landscape values collected through a regional public participation GIS (PPGIS) process with landscape components and classes from the New Zealand Land Classification (NZLC) system. We used chi-square residual analysis and correspondence analysis to identify significant spatial associations. The results indicate that the general public associate particular values with specific landscape components at a regional scale. Greater than expected landscape values were associated with urban areas, water features, indigenous landcover, and mountains. Fewer than expected landscape values were associated with flatter, agricultural landscapes. We discuss the benefits and limitations of these methods for landscape assessment in New Zealand. and in the absence of PPGIS data to directly measure landscape values, whether landscape components should be used to interpolate values for landscape assessment. We urge replication of the method in other regions to increase the external validity of the landscape value-physical landscape associations described herein. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

301	State interventions to govern social vulnerability highlight the complexity of contemporary states, marked by neoliberal agenda but also by progressive interventions and the desire for effectiveness. This paper draws on collaborative research with government agencies on social vulnerability in the Hunter region to assess the desirability of undertaking critical geographies with the state. We see states as contested terrains invested with the institutional capacity to mobilise diverse political projects. We argue that critical research in partnership with states is possible, as are mobilisations of the agency of state institutions to promote progressive policy development. The paper explores how we might use engaged research to intersect with the production and circulation of texts, technologies and practices within the state apparatus to achieve desirable change. While critical research with the state involves uncertainties and compromise, with no permanent resolutions, we conclude that states must remain centred in our critical conversations and praxis. In this paper we advance the case for the critical possibilities of policy-oriented research with the state. We reflect on experiences of an engaged research project with state government agencies in the NSW Hunter Region involving the production and use of the texts and technologies as state interventions in social vulnerability. Working through the project's reflexive, collaborative methodologies and our use of critical GIS, we highlight the creation of opportunities to change how the components of social vulnerability were conceptualised, contest policymakers view of what was relevant, and shift framing rationalities and resultant state practices. As such the paper contributes to our knowledge of strategic research practices for pursuing critical, progressive projects with the state. Such engagement involves uncertainties and contingent compromise. Yet, as terrains of contestation wherein diverse political projects are assembled and propelled, states must remain centred in our critical conversations and in our critical praxis.	10.1111/j.1467-8330.2011.00976.x	2012
302	Nonprofit organizations often pursue land acquisition as a nonpolitical, private property rights approach to conservation of ecological and cultural resources. Yet acquisition and regulatory land-use planning are intertwined, both in terms of political strategies and conservation outcomes. Our objectives are (1) to understand the relationship between the acquisition strategies of land trusts and their involvement in land-use planning and zoning, and (2) to examine how the interactions between acquisition and land-use planning may shape conservation outcomes. We focus on the strategies of The Nature Conservancy, one of the largest conservation NGOs in the United States. Drawing from an institutional analysis framework, we compare case studies from Tehama and Monterey Counties, California. Through semistructured interviews, analysis of land-use plans and conservation-easement agreements, and GIS mapping we examine political strategies and conservation outcomes. Our analysis reveals that acquisition strategies and the regulatory context influence each other strongly, but that tensions between the politics of these strategies challenge conservation actors to deploy both effectively. Finally, we develop themes for future research, suggesting that the implementation and assessment of regional conservation efforts would benefit from an integrated strategy that recognizes the synergistic linkages between acquisition and regulatory land-use planning.	10.1068/a44395	2012
303	This action-research project aimed to test a participatory mapping methodology using Google Earth to develop shared understandings among participants about sustainability and climate change. The process focused on improving knowledge uptake and enabling dialogue among participants in order to develop adaptation strategies for Rottnest Island, off the Western Australian coast. Project results indicate increased levels of knowledge and commitment to active involvement in sustainability and climate change issues. Common threads came together in a coherent set of recommendations that will contribute to ongoing climate change and sustainability planning by the Rottnest Island Authority. Major conclusions drawn include: the usefulness of Google Earth for participatory planning for climate adaptation and sustainability; the methodology enables social, economic, ecological and cultural layers to be considered without any having primacy; care must be taken to ensure knowledge and power differential are managed effectively; and, the methodology brought together stakeholders and scientists to co-produce knowledge and decisions.

304	Updating cadastral information is crucial for recording land ownership and property division changes in a timely fashioned manner. In most cases, the existing cadastral maps do not provide up-to-date information on land parcel boundaries. Such a situation demands that all the cadastral data and parcel boundaries information in these maps to be updated in a timely fashion. The existing techniques for acquiring cadastral information are discipline-oriented based on different disciplines such as geodesy, surveying, and photogrammetry. All these techniques require a large number of manpower, time, and cost when they are carried out separately. There is a need to integrate these techniques for acquiring cadastral information to update the existing cadastral data and (re)produce cadastral maps in an efficient manner. To reduce the time and cost involved in cadastral data acquisition, this study develops an integrated approach by integrating global position system (GPS) data, remote sensing (RS) imagery, and existing cadastral maps. For this purpose, the panchromatic image with 0.6 m spatial resolution and the corresponding multi-spectral image with 2.4m spatial resolution and 3 spectral bands from QuickBird satellite were used. A digital elevation model (DEM) was extracted from SPOT-5 stereopairs and some ground control points (GCPs) were also used for ortho-rectifying the QuickBird images. After ortho-rectifying these images and registering the multi-spectral image to the panchromatic image, fusion between them was attained to get good quality multi-spectral images of these two study areas with 0.6 m spatial resolution. Cadastral parcel boundaries were then identified on QuickBird images of the two study areas via visual interpretation using participatory-GIS (PGIS) technique. The regions of study are the urban and rural areas of Peshawar and Swabi districts in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The results are the creation of updated cadastral maps with a lot of cadastral information which can be used in updating the existing cadastral data with less time and cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

305	The evaluation of landscape services essentially deals with the complex and dynamic relationships between humans and their environment. When it comes to landscape management and the evaluation of the benefits these services provide for our well-being, there is a limited representation of stakeholder and intangible values on the land. Stakeholder knowledge is essential, since disciplinary expert evaluations and existing proxy data on landscape services can reveal little of the landscape benefits to the local stakeholders. This paper aims at evaluating the potential of using local stakeholders as key informants in the spatial assessment of landscape service indicators. A methodological approach is applied in the context of a rural village environment in Tanzania, Zanzibar, where local, spatially sensitive stakeholder knowledge is crucial in solving land management challenges as the resources are used extensively for supporting community livelihoods and are threatened by economic uses and agricultural expansion. A typology of 19 different material and non-material, cultural landscape service indicators is established and, in semi-structured interviews, community stakeholders map these indicators individually on an aerial image. The landscape service indicators are described and spatially analysed in order to establish an understanding of landscape level service structures, patterns and relationships. The results show that community involvement and participatory mapping enhance the assessment of landscape services. These benefits from nature demonstrate spatial clustering and co-existence, but simultaneously also a tendency for spatial dispersion, and suggest that there is far more heterogeneity and sensitivity in the ways the benefits are distributed in relation to actual land resources. Many material landscape service indicators are individually based and spatially scattered in the landscape. However, the well-being of communities is also dependent on the non-material services, pointing out shared places of social interaction and cultural traditions. Both material and non-material services are preferred closest to settlements where the highest intensity, richness and diversity are found. Based on the results, the paper discusses the role of local stakeholders as experts in landscape service assessments and implications for local level management processes. It can be pointed out that the integration of participatory mapping methods in landscape service assessments is crucial for true collaborative, bottom-up landscape management. It is also necessary in order to capture the non-utilitarian value of landscapes and sensitivity to cultural landscape services, which many expert evaluations of landscape or ecosystem services fail to do justice.

306	Geographical information systems (GIS) have been a part of archaeological research practices for over two decades, yet many significant questions related to the technology remain unanswered. Long-standing ambiguities about GIS use in archaeology can be associated with a particular research atmosphere within the discipline, where a large number of practitioners consider theory-laden critical approaches to GIS optional, if not peripheral, to conducting spatial analysis. This article calls on archaeological GIS practitioners to carry existing GIS theory and critique to another level. It also argues that the critique of the epistemological implications of GIS use in archaeology has largely (and at times rather implicitly) been structured by representational thinking habits and that a move to non-representational thinking would provide novel considerations of the technology.	10.1177/1469605312439139	2012
307	Public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) refers to methods that seek to integrate public knowledge of places to inform land use planning and decision making. There is little published information on the spatial accuracy of PPGIS data compared to expert-derived GIS data. This study assesses the spatial accuracy of PPGIS data collected for conservation planning in two regions of New Zealand in 2011 by comparing participant mapped locations of native vegetation with areas identified in the New Zealand Land Cover Database (LCDB) Version 2. Spatial error was operationalized as PPGIS locations having no native vegetation within 1000 m. The results indicate relatively low PPGIS spatial error of about 6% compared to 22% for randomly selected point locations in the regions. Spatial error is largest in coastal regions and near population centers where native vegetation is sparse and patchy. Participant familiarity with the study region is related to spatial error and is reflected in PPGIS sampling groups, with randomly sampled households having the largest error rate and the self-selected public, the lowest error rate. The results indicate a competitive, trade-off relationship between PPGIS participation rates and spatial accuracy. Future PPGIS research should identify processes with the capacity to increase both participation and spatial accuracy concurrently. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

308	Place values, like human values, are hypothesized to be relatively stable and slow to change over time. In 2004, we conducted a baseline study of place values, called landscape values, with residents of Kangaroo Island (KI), South Australia, using public participation GIS (PPGIS). In 2010, we implemented an internet-based PPGIS monitoring study with the same households to measure changes in the importance and spatial distribution of landscape values. The empirical results indicate general stability in values both in importance and spatial distribution. But the results also suggest that land-use changes such as those resulting from human development will significantly influence the distribution of landscape values. Additional research is needed to advance understanding of landscape values for identifying land-use compatibilities and conflict, and managing public lands in a manner consistent with public values.

309	Participatory mapping of indigenous lands and resources is increasingly seen as a precondition for securing legal recognition of indigenous land rights. But because participatory mapping might have unintended impacts on the functioning of rural communities, researchers have put a great effort in analyzing the effects of participatory mapping. In this article, we used a randomized evaluation to assess the effects of participatory mapping in conflicts with external actors and with neighbouring villages in the Tsimane' indigenous territory, Bolivian Amazon. We randomly assigned villages to a treatment and a control group, conducted participatory mapping with villages in the treatment group, and evaluated the effects of mapping village resources on the number of reported conflicts with and attitudes towards a) external actors and b) indigenous peoples from other villages. The exercise allows us to assess the effect of participatory mapping on conflicts while controlling for the political context. Results from our study indicate that conducting participatory mapping in randomly selected villages did not produce any effect of real or statistical significance on either 1) the number of conflicts with outsiders entering Tsimane' villages, 2) the number of conflicts with Tsimane' from other villages, 3) negative attitudes or opinions of outsiders, or 4) negative attitudes or opinion of Tsimane' from other villages. Our results suggest that some of the effects that have been attributed to participatory mapping are not the inevitable outcome of mapping per se; rather, they probably stem from other previous or ongoing processes that determine whether communities engage in mapping their lands and how they do so.

310	To improve communication between reindeer-herders and other land users, we developed and implemented a system to produce reindeer husbandry plans together with Sami reindeer-herding communities. A central component of our communications strategy was the introduction and use of a participatory GIS (pGIS). We evaluated the potential and limitations of pGIS as a tool for collaborative learning. We concluded that by merging traditional and scientific knowledge in a pGIS, the process of spatial communication has contributed to a more inclusive planning process, and to improved knowledge-sharing. Furthermore, the process has contributed to a more efficient long-term perspective where land use planning focuses on key areas but with solutions applied to the landscape. The Model Forest offered an appropriate platform to facilitate the process.	NA	2012
311	Besides topological relationships and approximate relationships, cardinal directions like north and southwest have turned out to be an important class of qualitative spatial relationships. They are of interdisciplinary interest in fields like cognitive science, robotics, artificial intelligence, and qualitative spatial reasoning. In spatial databases and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) they are frequently used as join and selection criteria in spatial queries. However, the available computational models of cardinal directions suffer a number of problems like the use of too coarse approximations of the two spatial operand objects in terms of single representative points or minimum bounding rectangles, the lacking property of converseness of the cardinal directions computed, and the limited applicability to simple instead of complex regions only. This article proposes and formally defines a novel two-phase model, called the Objects Interaction Matrix (OIM) model, that solves these problems, and determines cardinal directions for even complex regions. The model consists of a tiling phase and an interpretation phase. In the tiling phase, a tiling strategy first determines the zones belonging to the nine cardinal directions of each individual region object and then intersects them. The result leads to a bounded grid called objects interaction grid. For each grid cell the information about the region objects that intersect it is stored in an objects interaction matrix. In the subsequent interpretation phase, a well-defined interpretation method is applied to such a matrix and determines the cardinal direction. Spatial example queries illustrate our new cardinal direction concept that is embedded in a spatial extension of SQL and provides user-defined cardinal direction predicates.	10.1145/2188349.2188350	2012
312	This article examines how 2000 US census statistics serve to reproduce Arab Americans as a social body with specific political possibilities. Its first goal is to show how the conventionally used census data acts as a source of statistical and, furthermore, social and political marginalization by rendering Arab Americans, who poorly fit into its racial classification, either invisible or lacking in internal heterogeneity. The result is absent viable political identity for Arab Americans, general ignorance of their experiences in the United States, and negative stereotyping. Because in the post-9/11 United States, Arab American advocacy groups have turned to statistics, among other means, to forge positive visibility, our second goal is to suggest innovative and practical ways to make a more informed use of the existing census statistics despite that their categorical and numerical inconsistencies relative to Arab American identities. Instead of a quantitative analysis, we thus offer a feminist inspired method of \\mapping for difference\\" three census datasets-Arabic language spoken at home, place of birth in an Arab nation, and Arab ancestry, which involves applying a primarily qualitative analysis to these variables while contextualizing them by immigration history. Our result is a set of heterogeneous Arab American geographies, not intended for better quantitative description but serving to counter practices of marginalization by broadening public imagination and knowledge about this diverse community. Throughout, we suggest that while the designation Arab American maybe practically and politically useful, the recognition of the heterogeneity of Arab community along multiple dimensions of difference must be built into the methods of analysis. We demonstrate our major points with selected empirical maps from our larger research project on the census-based geographies of Arab Americans in the New York metropolitan area, one of the largest and most understudied communities in North America.

313	Volunteered geographic information and social networking in a WebGIS has the potential to increase public participation in soil and water conservation, promote environmental awareness and change, and provide timely data that may be otherwise unavailable to policymakers in soil and water conservation management. The objectives of this study were: (1) to develop a framework for combining current technologies, computing advances, data sources, and social media; and (2) develop and test an online web mapping interface. The mapping interface integrates Microsoft Silverlight, Bing Maps, ArcGIS Server, Google Picasa Web Albums Data API, RSS, Google Analytics, and Facebook to create a rich user experience. The website allows the public to upload photos and attributes of their own subdivisions or sites they have identified and explore other submissions. The website was made available to the public in early February 2011 at http://www.AbandonedDevelopments.com and evaluated for its potential longterm success in a pilot study.	10.1007/s00267-012-9818-5	2012
314	This paper identifies a failure by mobilities scholars to engage with the methodological and analytical possibilities offered by qualitative GIS. We argue this represents a missed opportunity and present the spatial transcript, a technique we have developed in order to address this shortcoming. Qualitative GIS seeks to find ways to analyse how space shapes data, offering a useful way in to investigating the mobile body. The spatial transcript allows researchers to engage in a process of grounded visualisation in order to analyse interview data in the context of the location in which it was gathered. We conclude that this technique offers valuable insights into the ways that space and mobilities are co-constructed.	10.1111/j.1475-4762.2011.01058.x	2012
315	Geographers play important roles in public health research, particularly in understanding healthcare accessibility, utilisation, and individual healthcare experiences. Most accessibility studies have benefited from the increased sophistication of geographic information systems (GIS). Some studies have been enhanced with semi-structured in-depth interviews to understand individual experiences of people as they access healthcare. However, few accessibility studies have explicitly utilised individual in-depth interview data in the construction of new GIS accessibility measures. Using mixed methods including GIS analysis and individual data from semi-structured in-depth interviews, we offer satisfaction-adjusted distance as a new way of conceptualising accessibility in GIS. Based on fieldwork in a predominantly lower-income community in Columbus, Ohio (USA), we find many residents felt neighbourhood healthcare facilities offered low-quality care, which suggested an added perceived distance as they attempt to access high-quality healthcare facilities. The satisfaction-adjusted distance measure accounts for the perceived distance some residents feel as they search for high-quality healthcare in lower-income urban neighbourhoods. In moving beyond conventional GIS and re-conceptualising accessibility in this way, we offer a more realistic portrayal of the issues lower-income urban residents face as they attempt to access high-quality healthcare facilities. The work has theoretical implications for conceptualising healthcare accessibility, advances the mixed-methodologies literature, and argues for a more equitable distribution of high-quality healthcare in urban neighbourhoods.	10.1111/j.1475-4959.2011.00411.x	2012
316	The geoweb represents a profound shift within regimes of the production, dissemination, and institutionalization of geographic information. Going beyond early geographic accounts of the geoweb that engage it as an extension of Web 2.0, this paper situates the emergence of the geoweb within the neoliberal political economic restructuring of the state. Drawing upon evidence of state, market, and citizen practices around Web-based spatial media and geoinformation, I argue that as the state is 'rolling back' from public aspects of the cartographic project, market regimes of governance are simultaneously 'rolling out', subsuming the mapping enterprise to the imperatives of technoscientific capitalism.	10.1177/0309132511411231	2012
320	The interface between neogeography and citizen science has great potential for environmental monitoring, but this nexus has been explored less often than each subject individually. In this article we review the emerging role of volunteered geographic information in citizen science and present a case study of an integrated tool set that engages multiple types of users (from targeted citizen-based observation networks, expert-driven focused monitoring, and opportunistic crowdsourcing efforts) in monitoring a forest disease in the western United States. We first introduce the overall challenge of data collection in environmental monitoring projects and then discuss the literature surrounding an emergent integration of citizen science and volunteered geographical information. We next explore how these methods characterize and underpin knowledge discovery and how multimodal interaction is supported so that a large spectrum of contributors can be included. These concepts are summarized in a conceptual model that articulates the important gradients of Web-based environmental monitoring: the users, the interaction between users and data, and the types of information generated. Using this model, we critically examine OakMapper.org, a Web site created by the authors to collect and distribute spatial information related to the spread of a forest disease, and discuss many of the core issues and new challenges presented by the intersection of citizen science and volunteered geographic information in the context of environmental monitoring. We argue that environmental monitoring can benefit from this synergy: The increased emphasis on a diversity of participants in knowledge production might help to reduce the gaps that have in the past divided the public, researchers, and policymakers in such efforts.	10.1080/00045608.2011.627058	2012
321	The dry rangelands of West Asia and North Africa are fragile and severely degraded due to low rainfall and mismanagement of natural resources. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) interventions are used to increase soil moisture content, vegetation cover, and productivity. However, adoption of rainwater harvesting by communities is slow. To understand adoption constraints and to develop options for sustainable integration of rainwater harvesting, a benchmark watershed was established in the dry rangelands of Jordan. The objective is to develop a methodology for identifying the suitability for different rainwater harvesting interventions using participatory GIS approach and field survey. The main biophysical parameters used to assess the suitability for rainwater harvesting were slope, soil depth, soil texture, and stoniness. Criteria for each parameter were integrated and a suitability map was produced using raster-based and polygon-based analysis. To integrate biophysical and socio-economic aspects, the land tenure was superimposed with the suitability map. Options for implementing different rainwater harvesting interventions were identified with the participation of the local communities. Field investigations indicated that the applied approach helped to select the most promising fields. Within two years, four types of rainwater harvesting were implemented in the fields of 41 farmers, covering 62.9 hectares, which helped to increase water productivity (kg/m(3)) four folds and reducing soil erosion five folds compared to fields without rainwater harvesting. The approach showed that participatory GIS approach may be used to integrate socio-economic and biophysical criteria and facilitate the participation of farmers to introduce rainwater harvesting interventions in dry rangeland systems to mitigate land degradation.	10.1080/15324982.2012.709214	2012
322	This study evaluated the use of an Internet-based public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) to identify ecosystem services in Grand County, Colorado. Specific research objectives were to examine the distribution of ecosystem services, identify the characteristics of participants in the study, explore potential relationships between ecosystem services and land use and land cover (LULC) classifications, and assess the methodological strengths and weakness of the PPGIS approach for identifying ecosystem services. Key findings include: (1) Cultural ecosystem service opportunities were easiest to identify while supporting and regulatory services most challenging, (2) participants were highly educated, knowledgeable about nature and science, and have a strong connection to the outdoors, (3) some LULC classifications were logically and spatially associated with ecosystem services, and (4) despite limitations, the PPGIS method demonstrates potential for identifying ecosystem services to augment expert judgment and to inform public or environmental policy decisions regarding land use trade-offs.	10.1080/08941920.2011.621511	2012
323	The convergence of newly interactive Web-based technologies with growing practices of user-generated content disseminated on the Internet is generating a remarkable new form of geographic information. Citizens are using handheld devices to collect geographic information and contribute it to crowd-sourced data sets, using Web-based mapping interfaces to mark and annotate geographic features, or adding geographic location to photographs, text, and other media shared online. These phenomena, which generate what we refer to collectively as volunteered geographic information (VGI), represent a paradigmatic shift in how geographic information is created and shared and by whom, as well as its content and characteristics. This article, which draws on our recently completed inventory of VGI initiatives, is intended to frame the crucial dimensions of VGI for geography and geographers, with an eye toward identifying its potential in our field, as well as the most pressing research needed to realize this potential. Drawing on our ongoing research, we examine the content and characteristics of VGI, the technical and social processes through which it is produced, appropriate methods for synthesizing and using these data in research, and emerging social and political concerns related to this new form of information.	10.1080/00045608.2011.595657	2012
324	Recent scholarship has urged increased attention to how advances in geographical information systems (GIS) technology can more equitably help to bridge gaps between the theory and practice of environmental protection and dispute resolution. This study brings new evidence to burgeoning debates in the Amazon, examining how a United Nations (UN) development initiative developed mapping systems in a shifting political climate for environmental governance while conducting campaigns with peasant miners to address environmental management. Amendments made in 2002 to the Brazilian Forest Code established natural preserves according to the geographic features of watersheds. The laws deter commercial land use on preserves, imposing strict penalties where artisanal mining is widely prevalent as a livelihood. The UN program utilized GIS and Shuttle Radar imagery to map the contested areas according to legal definitions and engaged stakeholders to discuss political implications. In 2006, new reforms made such mapping tools even more controversial-and urgent-with amendments that created opportunities for bringing \\informal\\" mining into the legal sphere, theoretically allowing \\"spaces of exception\\" where mining can be legitimated. Our multimethod study underscores the need for appreciating diverse understandings of ecologically sensitive zones and empowering rural communities to take ownership over geospatial technologies in addressing environmental challenges. Although maps produced using the proposed methods could be useful, dominant advocacies that champion GIS as an enforcement tool often undermine local trust, inflame tensions, and render alternative \\"grassrootsGIS\\" strategies impracticable. We examine the contexts, powers, limitations, and risks of the UN's technical intervention, exploring how competing views of environmental controversy lead to divergent perspectives on the politics of GIS \\"knowledge translation\\" and mapping itself."	10.1080/00045608.2011.641861	2012
325	Collaborative and community-based approaches to conservation and natural resource management often utilize maps that designate particular areas as being high priorities for conservation. These maps are used in stakeholder workshops and/or public discourse, but have often been highly contentious and counterproductive. We propose that quantifying and visualizing some of the uncertainty involved in making such maps could decrease their potential for causing conflict, thereby facilitating discourse and eventually, conservation action. We propose that an extra bonus could be attained by mapping the effects of missing or sparse input data regarding landowner \\willingness to conserve\\" (given fair market compensation). The primary contributions of this action research are in the development of the propositions and in their implementation using a stochastic approach (Monte Carlo simulation). Preliminary assessment of the propositions occurred, but further research is needed to more formally evaluate them. Some practical suggestions and additional research considerations are provided."	10.1080/08941920.2011.578119	2012
326	The collection of spatial information through public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) is most frequently implemented using either point or polygon spatial features but the research trade-offs between the two methods are not well-understood. In a quasi-experimental PPGIS design, we collected four attributes (aesthetic, recreation, economic, and biological values) as both point and polygon spatial features in the same PPGIS study. We then used Monte Carlo simulation methods to describe the relationship between the quantity of data collected and the degree of spatial convergence in the two methods for each of the four PPGIS attributes. The results demonstrate that the same PPGIS attributes identified by points and polygons will converge on a collective spatial 'truth' within the study area provided there are enough observations, however, the degree of spatial convergence varies by PPGIS attribute type and the quantity of data collected. The use of points for mapping PPGIS attributes and aggregating areas through density mapping constitutes a conservative approach to spatial inference about place significance, but the data demands for point collection are considerably higher than for polygon features. Based on our results, we provide heuristic guidelines for future PPGIS research when using point or polygon spatial attributes. We argue that other variables such as the cognitive complexity of the PPGIS mapping process and stronger claims of external validity favor the use of point features, but these advantages must be weighed against the significantly higher sampling effort required.	10.1080/13658816.2011.585139	2012
327	The last few decades have seen increasing attempts to foster 'collaborative' and 'participatory' approaches to spatial planning and decision-making, with a more sophisticated conceptualisation of the contested term, participation. Participatory, 'bottom-up' geo-information technologies have been concurrently developing and these are expected to strengthen participatory spatial planning: important among these has been the transformation of conventional mapping and GIS tools into Participatory GIS (PGIS). In this paper we explore the potential contributions of participatory geo-information tools towards participatory spatial planning, in terms of the principles and criteria of good governance. We discuss five fundamental principles of 'good' governance: accountability, legitimacy, respect, equity, and competence, and the potential of geo-information tools to contribute to, and detract from, such principles: although we focus especially on participation and the recognition and validation of local knowledge. We derive criteria for the five principles, and we identify a range of evaluation questions which can be operationalised so as to interrogate the criteria for judging the contribution of participatory tools and participatory spatial planning activities. We conclude by summarily assessing the potentials of participatory geo-information tools, particularly participatory mobile GIS, participatory 3-dimensional modelling, and visualisation features in PGIS.

328	In order to design computer systems that are intuitive to use, the way humans reason about their \\real world\\" surroundings needs to be taken into consideration. Geographic  however the concept of proximity or nearness, which is essential in many forms of human reasoning, is still being addressed insufficiently. This paper provides a thorough and comprehensive synthesis of the disparate literature that pertains to the subject of proximity. It offers insights into why existing methods for reasoning with proximity work, or do not work, and analyses their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the paper provides the derivation of new proximity measures, and their evaluation, backed by experiments and reflections. New measures are formally described in a unifying and compelling framework. This framework acknowledges that while distance is one factor that influences proximity perception, proximity is much more than just a distance measure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

329	This paper focuses on the potential impact of student-centered feedback for enhancing the learning experience of civil engineering students that used a geographic information system (GIS) based tutorial in a transportation engineering course. The tutorial was implemented in a laboratory environment developed as a self-guided activity supported by a web-based learning system. The formative research proposed in this study includes a series of four successive implementations of this laboratory. Students' performance, beliefs, and perceptions were monitored by using a mixed-methods design approach and weaknesses identified from early implementations were addressed before the next implementation of the laboratory activity. The students' performance was found to improve when the GIS web-based tutorial was complemented with an instructor-driven short introduction that anchored the laboratory activity in traffic safety. In addition, students' feedback in both quantitative and qualitative format indicated weaknesses related to the difficulty of the laboratory and usability factors such as speed and size of data uploading. As these weaknesses were addressed, students' positive input regarding the overall GIS laboratory experience significantly increased. This positive input was fully backed up by students' feedback indicating major strengths of the GIS laboratory for professional growth and future career development in civil and transportation engineering. Finally, students' inputs in the latest implementations provided valuable suggestions for future potential improvements regarding how to better integrate the GIS laboratory in course-related activities such as term projects.

330	The literature on neighborhoods and health highlights the difficulty of operationalizing \\neighborhood\\" in a conceptually and empirically valid manner. Most studies, however, continue to define neighborhoods using less theoretically relevant boundaries, risking erroneous inferences from poor measurement. We review an innovative methodology to address this problem, called the socio-spatial neighborhood estimation method (SNEM). To estimate neighborhood boundaries, researchers used a theoretically informed combination of qualitative GIS and on-the-ground observations in Texas City, Texas. Using data from a large sample, we assessed the SNEM-generated neighborhood units by comparing intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and multi-level model parameter estimates of SNEM-based measures against those for census block groups and regular grid cells. ICCs and criterion-related validity evidence using SF-36 outcome measures indicate that the SNEM approach to operationalization could improve inferences based on neighborhoods and health research.

332	This paper describes research to evaluate the use of a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) methodology for national park planning. Visitor perceptions of park experiences, environmental impacts, and facility needs were collected via an internet-based mapping method for input into a national park planning decision support system. The PPGIS method presupposes that consistent with the dominant statutory framework, national parks should be managed for both visitor enjoyment and natural and cultural resource protection. This paper: (1) describes the PPGIS method used in a 2009 park planning study conducted for national parks in the Greater Alpine region of Victoria, Australia; (2) presents and evaluates selected results of the Greater Alpine study and provides examples of how PPGIS data can be used for decision support in park planning; (3) provides a summary of lessons learned including a discussion of future implementation constraints. The results demonstrate that an internet, participatory mapping method, though not without limitations, can be effective in measuring visitor experiences, environmental impacts, and facility needs for a variety of park planning processes. PPGIS expands a park agency's repertoire of methods to engage the public in planning and can help build and sustain trust in a park agency's planning process and decisions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

333	Mapping technologies have made considerable strides in recent decades. Global positioning systems (GPS), remote sensing satellites, Web-based mapping services, and geographic information systems (GIS) have facilitated the collection, distribution, analysis, and ultimately interaction with geospatial information. In particular, portable GPS have altered how individuals participate in mapping. Individuals can use GPS to collect tracings of their personal interactions with the environment. These interactions can then be uploaded to one of many available Web-based mapping services. Once uploaded, the geospatial data can be mapped and shared among the broader community of users. Such volunteered geographic information (VGI) exemplifies the conceptualization of an individual collecting, mapping, and sharing personal geographic information. This paper focuses on challenges surrounding VGI. To help place these challenges in a broader context, specialized Web services and GPS technologies developed for the bicycling community will serve as examples of the current status and future prospects of VGI.	10.1559/15230406382258	2011
334	This article discusses some new ways in which social work research can explore the interaction between neighbourhoods and child and adult well-being. The authors note that social work practices are often criticised for taking an individualistic approach and paying too little attention to the service user's environment. The article uses examples of research projects from Chile, the USA and Wales, to discuss the use of spatially oriented research methods for understanding neighbourhood factors. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods approaches that are particularly appropriate for investigating social work-relevant topics are discussed in turn, including quantitative and qualitative uses for geographical information systems (GIS), hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) for analysing spatially clustered data and qualitative mobile interviews. The article continues with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of using spatially orientated research designs in social work research settings and concludes optimistically with suggestions for future directions in this area.	10.1093/bjsw/bcq123	2011
335	This review considers two recent trajectories of research on the geospatial web: efforts to develop appropriate methodologies for working with the new forms of geographic information that are part of it, and studies of its cultural, social, and political significance. In both arenas, visualization and visual methods are central. I show how methodologies drawn from quantitative and qualitative approaches to geovisualization in GIScience offer productive ways of working with geoweb-based information in research, and examine recent efforts to use critical visual methods to study the geoweb as visual practice.	10.1177/0309132510374250	2011
336	Social, economic, and ecological criteria contribute to the successful design, implementation, and management of marine protected areas (MPAs). In the context of California's Marine Life Protection Act Initiative, we developed a set of methods for collecting, compiling, and analyzing data about the spatial extent and relative economic importance of commercial and recreational fishing. We interviewed 174 commercial fishers who represented the major fisheries in the initiative's north-central coast region, which extends from Point Arena south to Pigeon Point. These fishers provided data that we used to map the extent of each of the fishing grounds, to weight the relative importance of areas within the grounds, to characterize the operating costs of each fishery, and to analyze the potential economic losses associated with proposed marine protected areas. A regional stakeholder group used the maps and impact analyses in conjunction with other data sets to iteratively identify economic and ecological trade-offs in designations of different areas as MPAs at regional, port, and fishery extents. Their final proposed MPA network designated 20% of state waters as MPAs. Potential net economic loss ranged from 1.7% to 14.2% in the first round of network design and totaled 6.3% in the final round of design. This process is a case study in the application of spatial analysis to validate and integrate local stakeholder knowledge in marine planning.	10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01626.x	2011
337	Despite significant growth in public participation GIS (PPGIS) literature since the 1990s, little engagement by e-government scholars is evident in the extensive scholarly PPGIS debates. To fill this void, recent trends in PPGIS adoption by local governments are analyzed. Three waves of GIS are identified: desktop GIS, web GIS, and the Geospatial Web 2.0 platform. Such technological advancements have progressively eased GIS accessibility from expert users to ordinary citizens, accompanied by considerable growth in adopting PPGIS for traffic and transit, volunteered geographic information, and customer relationship management. However, limited use of PPGIS for higher levels of participation such as decision making is found. Barriers to PPGIS adoption for decision making seem less technological and more institutional.	10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02226.x	2011
338	Following the Educational Reform Act of 1988, families in England and Wales have been free to identify a preferred school for their children's secondary education. However, as part of this open selection, the demand from parents opting to send their children to the best performing schools far outstrips the supply of available places at them, and consequently many schools ration places using entry criteria that favour those pupils domiciled close to the school. Through this geographic selection process, choice is spatially sorted and access to the best schools is often crucially dependent upon where parents live. After illustrating this problem, this paper develops an automated modelling technique that can be used to define and map school catchment areas based on the home locations of pupils attending every publically funded school in England. It then develops this framework to create a web based decision support tool to aid parents seeking secondary school places. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

339	With the rise of smart phones and ever more sophisticated handheld computers, many that now incorporate GPS (''sat nav'') technologies, there is tremendous potential for undertaking mixed-method research, including the collection of spatially referenced data. The increasing ubiquity and simplicity of mobile computing, as well as reduced cost, mean that the barriers to social scientists using these devices in the field have been significantly reduced. This article reports on two case studies using these technologies to investigate fear of crime and studentification. Participants generate spatial data simply by walking around an area, interacting with mobile devices through a simplistic interface. The resulting maps allow a more general spatial analysis of the issues to be undertaken, which can then be examined in more depth using qualitative data produced alongside the mobile computing activities. The article concludes that these approaches can be valuable in augmenting conventional qualitative data collection but emphasizes the importance of simple user interfaces both for participants and researcher.	10.1177/1525822X10388467	2011
340	Brazil has 109 million hectares of sustainable use reserves (SURs), most of them in Amazonia. In practical terms, SURs are being created to meet several objectives, but this process can and should be improved. The absence of a clear goal and the lack of basic social and biological information for such areas can compromise the goals, frustrate the people demanding the SURs and complicate the selection of the most adequate size, shape and category to be adopted. The data collection process used in the creation and management of protected areas is often compromised by under-funded environmental agencies, a lack of qualified human resources or the unawareness of accessible, quick, simple and inexpensive geographical methodologies able to facilitate such processes. The dissemination of tools and methods oriented to improve the management of and the decision-making process for protected areas in such adverse scenarios is necessary. Here we describe the execution of a participatory geographic information system (PGIS) to gain information on how human populations are living and using natural resources in the Maues State Forest, an SUR in Brazilian Amazonia. The PGIS allowed data acquisition for 415 families, 444 houses, 597 agricultural and animal-raising areas, 138 fishing sites, 106 hunting sites and 225 extraction sites within a short period of time (<than 20 days) and with accessible costs (<US$ 10,000). We classified and located the activities and points being used, the areas under stronger pressure and the hotspots for conservation, estimating that nearly 30% of the reserve was under direct use by its residents. We discuss the conservation implications of our findings and strongly recommend that the collection and mapping of socio-economic information should be prerequisite before the creation of any SURs in Brazilian Amazonia.

341	Social scientists have begun engaging with participants 'on the move' in a variety of ways. This paper presents the results of a pilot study, which deployed a qualitative GIS technique to analyse the effectiveness of walked interviews in capturing data relating to people's understanding of place. We give an account of the walking interview exploring two issues: the relationship between what people say and where they say it: and qualitative and quantitative differences between data generated by walking and sedentary interviews. Our results indicate that the data generated through walking interviews are profoundly informed by the landscapes in which they take place, emphasising the importance of environmental features in shaping discussions. We also demonstrate a measureable difference between walking and sedentary techniques in the production of rich place narratives both in terms of their quantity and spatial specificity to the study area. The paper concludes by acknowledging that a technocentric analysis of place runs the risk of emphasising locational above humanistic elements, but argues that, done sensitively, a qualitative GIS approach offers great potential for engaging planners and policy makers with the importance of local connections to place.

342	This article presents a methodology for designing a WebGIS framework intended for automatically analyzing spatial data and updating statistics of interest with new information inserted daily by multiple users via a Web portal. A practical example is used on vehicle accident data for assessing risk in specific road segments. Two main blocks integrated together will be described: the collaborative block and the data-analysis block. The former gives end-users computer-aided tools to view, insert, modify and manage data related to accidents and traffic monitoring sensors, whereas the latter is developed to automatically analyze the accident data coming from user's collaboration. Because different agencies can survey accident sites, a collaborative environment is necessary - and a Web-based solution is ideal - for permitting multi-user access and data insertion. A centralized approach to process the data in real time is described in all its components. Server-side Structured Query Language functions optimize performance by using dedicated libraries for spatial processing and re-structuring the attributes associated with elements which are consequently re-classified for correct color-scaling. The end-product is a system that provides a seamless integration of front-end tools for user collaboration and back-end tools to update accident risk statistics in real time and provide them to stakeholders.	10.1111/j.1467-9671.2011.01248.x	2011
343	This article suggests a framework for incorporating and communicating local perceptions of hurricane risk into policymaking through a case study conducted at El Zapotito commune in the State of Veracruz, Mexico. The authors constructed a geographical information system (GIS)-based model to quantify and spatially assess specific household-level vulnerabilities from information generated through interviews. This research developed a household vulnerability index applied to a participatory GIS to map vulnerability to hurricane hazard. The results indicate that infrastructural weaknesses are the most important factor contributing to vulnerability, explaining on their own 72.2% of the variation in the vulnerability patterns. These findings are corroborated by a vulnerability and capacity assessment (VCA), which shows that the community lacks strategies to cope with unsafe housing. It is suggested that linking community participation with modern techniques to analyse risk can empower communities and mobilise their capacities to address very specific vulnerabilities.

344	Urban planning processes are complex and multidimensional and they require re-thinking of traditional approaches. One of the theories increasingly researched by urban planners is realisation of participatory planning to facilitate public participation. This approach, as an effective bottom-up method, should increase the capabilities of planners to solve urban problems by including the general public in the urban planning process. This paper proposes a framework for a Web-based spatial decision support system (WebGIS-SDSS) adjusted to a participatory urban planning approach. The framework, called Web-based participatory urban planning (WPUP), has been implemented in a case study. It offers a Web-based spatial forum to demonstrate how the proposed system can not only help citizens to share their idea regarding urban plans, but also help planners to implement applicable bottom-up and public participation decision-making theory in the urban planning process. WPUP supports the deliberative and analytic components of the collaborative spatial decision-making process. It facilitates inclusion of local knowledge in urban planning to complement traditional approaches. WPUP provides easy access to urban plans and decisions, improves communication among planners and public, involves citizens' preferences on planning in a timely manner, and finally facilitates participatory planning approach.	10.1080/14498596.2011.623347	2011
345	One of the keys to environmental management is to understand the impact and interaction of people with natural resources as a means to improve human welfare and the consequent environmental sustainability for future generations. In terms of water management one of the on-going challenges is to assess what impact interventions in agriculture, and in particularly different irrigation strategies, will have on livelihoods and water resources in the landscape. Whilst global and national policy provide the overall vision of desired outcomes for environmental management, agricultural development and water use strategies they are often presented with local challenges to embed these policies in the reality on the ground, with different stakeholder groups. The concept that government agencies, advocacy organizations, and private citizens should work together to identify mutually acceptable solutions to environmental and water resource issues is increasing in prominence. Participatory spatial engagement techniques linked to geographic information systems (commonly termed participatory GIS (PGIS)) offers one solution to facilitate such stakeholder dialogues in an efficient and consultative manner. In the context of agricultural water management multi-scale PGIS techniques have recently been piloted as part of the 'Agricultural Water Management Solutions' project to investigate the current use and dependencies of water by small-holder farmers a watershed in Tanzania. The piloted approach then developed PGIS scenarios describing the effects on livelihoods and water resources in the watershed when introducing different management technologies. These relatively rapid PGIS multi-scale methods show promise for assessing current and possible future agriculture water management technologies in terms of their bio-physical and socio-economic impacts at the watershed scale. The paper discusses the development of the methodology in the context of improved water management decision making. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	10.1016/j.pce.2011.07.039	2011
346	International discussions on the demand responsive approach (DRA) started in the mid-1990s because past supply-driven approaches had led to the failure of many water supply and sewerage/on-site sanitation (WS&S/OS) projects in developing countries (DCs). DRA has already been adopted in many WS&S/OS projects targeting a certain rural or poor urban area(s) by using various demand assessment techniques such as participatory rapid appraisal (PRA) to select optimum technical options. However, adoption of DRA in large-scale urban WS&S/OS projects (covering various areas of different socioeconomic groups with different needs) has been relatively delayed. Recently, the participatory geographic information system (PGIS) has emerged as an effective method of PRA, and high resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) has become commercially available. This paper presents a PGIS-based visual area categorization of different income groups using HRSI as a key for expediting the adoption of DRA to large-scale projects in DCs. This paper proposes an innovative pro-poor methodology of DRA for large-scale urban WS&S/OS projects. The methodology focuses on the improvement of multistage sampling in a household sample survey to plan mixed services suitable for various groups. The results of a partial application of the methodology in Pakistan are also presented.	10.2166/aqua.2011.081	2011
347	Studies have shown racial disparities in neighborhood access to healthy food in the United States. We used a mixed methods approach employing geographic information systems, focus groups, and a survey to examine African Americans' perceptions of the neighborhood nutrition environment in Pittsburgh. We found that African Americans perceive that supermarkets serving their community offer produce and meats of poorer quality than branches of the same supermarket serving White neighborhoods (p < 0.001). Unofficial taxis or jitneys, on which many African Americans are reliant, provide access from only certain stores; people are therefore forced to patronize these stores even though they are perceived to be of poorer quality. Community-generated ideas to tackle the situation include ongoing monitoring of supermarkets serving the Black community. We conclude that stores should make every effort to be responsive to the perceptions and needs of their clients and provide an environment that enables healthy eating. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

348	This article addresses an effort to incorporate wireless sensor networks and the emerging tools of the Geoweb into undergraduate teaching and research at a small liberal arts college. The primary goal of the research was to identify the hardware, software, and skill sets needed to deploy a local sensor network, collect data, and transmit that data over the Internet in a format that could be viewed and analyzed by an end user. A second goal of the project was to identify new skills and technologies that could be incorporated into existing GIS and computer science courses in order to better prepare students for the changing landscape of the Geoweb.	10.1080/00221341.2010.507777	2011
349	Drawing on recent debates pointing to the value of mixed methods research in human geography, the authors revisit a quantitative location analysis model previously created to site palliative care services in rural British Columbia, Canada. The original quantitative model posited that population (i.e., number of residents in the community), isolation (i.e., travel time to existing specialized palliative care), and vulnerability (i.e., number of residents older than 65 years in the community) are three factors that must be accounted for when siting palliative care services in rural areas. Using qualitative interview data, the authors refine this model to include a newly identified factor: community readiness. They conclude with a discussion of the benefits of adopting a mixed methods approach to location analysis model development.	10.1177/1558689810385693	2011

351	This paper explores a technical solution (GIS-application) as a possible alternative for public participation in coastal decision-making. Through examination of a Scottish local case study, the paper examines the evidence that Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and more specifically Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS), can lead to or influence greater legitimacy in decision making in public participation in coastal management and waterfront development. Whilst demonstrating that GIS and PPGIS have considerable potential to provide the public with access to accurate data and factual information, to be able to integrate multiple and disparate data sources to allow merging of data, and to use various visualisation techniques, the complexities associated with PPGIS suggest that further research is required to establish if and how participatory GIS can increase legitimacy in a decision-making process.

352	This article proposes the use of content clouds as a method of exploratory qualitative data analysis. Content clouds are a type of visualisation that summarises the contents of a document by depicting the words that appear most often in larger, darker type within the cloud. When utilised as a form of qualitative GIS, content clouds provide a powerful way to summarise and compare information from different places on a single issue. Two examples using different types of documents and differently-scaled environmental issues demonstrate the possible utility of this method in summarising qualitative data and suggesting avenues for research.	10.1111/j.1475-4762.2010.00952.x	2010
353	Health is increasingly understood as a product of multiple levels of influence, from individual biological and behavioral influences to community and societal level contextual influences. In understanding these contextual influences, community health researchers have increasingly employed both geographic methodologies, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and community participatory approaches. However, despite growing interest in the role for community participation and local knowledge in community health investigations, and the use of geographical methods and datasets in characterizing community environments, there exist few examples of research projects that incorporate both geographical and participatory approaches in addressing health questions. This is likely due in part to concerns and restrictions regarding community access to confidential health data. In order to overcome this barrier, we present a method for linking confidential, geocoded health information with community-generated experiential geographical information in a GIS environment. We use sophisticated disease mapping methodologies to create continuously defined maps of colorectal cancer in Iowa, then incorporate these layers in an open source GIS application as the context for a participatory community mapping exercise with participants from a rural Iowa town. Our method allows participants to interact directly with health information at a fine geographical scale, facilitating hypothesis generation regarding contextual influences on health, while simultaneously protecting data confidentiality. Participants are able to use their local, geographical knowledge to generate hypotheses about factors influencing colorectal cancer risk in the community and opportunities for risk reduction. This work opens the door for future efforts to integrate empirical epidemiological data with community generated experiential information to inform community health research and practice.	10.1007/s10900-010-9254-5	2010
354	Objective: To analyse the association between childhood overweight and obesity and the density and proximity of fast food outlets in relation to the child's residential postcode. Design: This was an observational study using individual level height/weight data and geographic information systems methodology. Setting: Leeds in West Yorkshire, UK. This area consists of 476 lower super-output areas. Participants: Children aged 3-14 years who lived within the Leeds metropolitan boundaries (n=33,594). Main outcome measures: The number of fast food outlets per area and the distance to the nearest fast food outlet from the child's home address. The weight status of the child: overweight, obese or neither. Results: 27.1% of the children were overweight or obese with 12.6% classified as obese. There is a significant positive correlation (p < 0.001) between density of fast food outlets and higher deprivation. A higher density of fast food outlets was significantly associated (p=0.02) with the child being obese (or overweight/obese) in the generalised estimating equation model which also included sex, age and deprivation. No significant association between distance to the nearest fast food outlet and overweight or obese status was found. Conclusions: There is a positive relationship between the density of fast food outlets per area and the obesity status of children in Leeds. There is also a significant association between fast food outlet density and areas of higher deprivation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	10.1016/j.healthplace.2010.07.003	2010
355	A web-based collaborative-argumentation mapping experiment, which was used as part of a planning process in the city of Tampere, Finland, revealed a need for analytical tools to interpret the users' meaning making with this particular public participation GIS instrument. The main reason for this was the complexity of mediated interaction between different actors in and by means of the application: written comments, graphic symbols, and aerial photographs were combined to make meaning in particular context-specific situations. An analytical framework is discussed; it is shown to have the potential to grasp this type of signification process by studying the dynamics of different semiotic means and the production of discourse and settings in practice.	10.1068/b36002	2010
356	This short article reviews and critically appraises Kingsbury and Jones' (2009) Geoforum article entitled \\Walter Benjamin's Dionysian Adventures on Google Earth\\", and finds it lacking in several regards. First, the use of Nietzsche's Dionysus/Apollo dichotomy is in fact a double binary, in which Apollonian logic is constructed as a binary within the dichotomy, while the Dionysian logic is 'bacchanalian'. Second, Walter Benjamin as exemplar of Dionysian logic is shown to be problematic and more a distraction from the flawed Nietzschean logic than a useful construct in itself. Lastly, the educational potential of Google Earth is overlooked by Kingsbury and Jones, in their haste to see Google Earth through 'Google goggles', in which everything Google appears through Dionysian-tinted lenses.

357	A variety of GIS-based collaborative decision support procedures exist that aim at involving the public in community planning and decision-making processes. Although the importance of consensus-building methods has been recognized in the collaborative decision support applications, there has been very little research addressing the problem of measuring consensus in the context of spatial collaborative decision-making. The main aim of this paper is to present an implementation of a consensus measuring procedure within WebGIS-based collaborative decision support tool. The collaborative tool, called Participatory-GIS.com, has been used for tackling a site-selection problem in the Town of Canmore, Alberta. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

358	Public participation is required in neighborhood infrastructure planning and problem-solving. Although Participatory GIS methods are considered important to help urban community groups identify problems and express their needs and concerns, usable means to help groups produce their maps remain difficult to be realised. Further, an effective means to facilitate the integration of government spatial plans and participatory maps also remains unclear. This article addresses usability issues in participatory mapping activities by exploring group collaboration mechanics and accomplishing use assessments. The study aims at testing the usefulness and the impact of participatory mapping for community development. User studies including questionnaire surveys, interviews, group usability testing, scenario assessments, and the scaling-up activity were executed. Transparent photomaps, Mobile GIS, and a Web map were implemented and assessed in the study area. A use scenario for community and official spatial data integration was also developed. The results of user studies show that the use of transparent photomaps is more effective to complete group tasks to discuss, draw, and annotate their infrastructure problems. For group participants, the transparent maps are more engaging, easy to learn, and more error tolerant than the use of Mobile GIS. A combination use of simple and advanced PGIS methods is necessary to be implemented to reach informed priority-decision making.	10.1111/j.1467-9671.2010.01206.x	2010
359	Excavations are easy in the soft, unconsolidated sediments of Bangladesh and are widespread for the creation of raised, flood-free homestead platforms. Small water bodies form in the resulting hollows and are used for fisheries, livestock management, irrigation, bathing and washing clothes. Despite their importance to everyday life, there is no up-to-date inventory or monitoring. The paper uses remote sensing, GIS and a number of qualitative data collection techniques to reconstruct the pattern of small water bodies in Shahjadpur thana. It concludes that there has been an expansion in their number, but no systematic planning of their use.	10.1111/j.1475-4762.2009.00909.x	2010
360	Sustainable development and successful urban regeneration ideally require engagement with the affected communities. Existing methods employed by policymakers and planners often fail to reach significant segments of communities, the so-called 'hard-to-reach'. This paper describes the development of an innovative participatory GIS methodology specifically aimed at overcoming the barriers to engagement experienced by these groups. The application of the method is illustrated with reference to three recent case studies carried out in UK cities. The paper will then discuss the novelty of this approach in comparison with other participatory engagement techniques. The ethical implications of the technique are also discussed.	10.1111/j.1475-4762.2009.00912.x	2010
361	Recent advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Web 2.0 technologies provide new ways of creating sophisticated Web applications that strengthen social interactions based on comments on online maps, which have the potential to improve Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) practices. In this paper, we address this promising approach to analyze the impact of collaborative Web 2.0 tools applied to PPGIS applications in urban planning actions. We develop a Web 2.0 PPGIS application through free, easy-to-use tools, which consist of a Web mapping service, with eligible geospatial data layers, where users explore and comment. A database stores the contributions in a format supported by GIS. We also set up a prototype version in Canela (Brazil), to test its usability. The results showed that it is a valuable approach for engaging the public. It could promote communication among users and decision makers in a more interactive and straightforward way. Besides, it is easy to set up and understandable by non-experts. The Web 2.0 PPGIS may serve as a social tool for any spatially-related issue involving community members in any context.

362	This essay describes an effort to create a user-friendly Geographic Information Systems (GIS) map of historic and contemporary Indian allotment lands in Plumas and Lassen counties. Because of the nonratification of treaties with California tribes, most unrecognized Mountain Maidu do not see themselves spatially represented despite their collective presence. By appropriating tools of representation (maps), and assimilation (allotments), the act of mapping allotments resists the attempted political and spatial erasure of unrecognized California Indians. As allotments continue to change hands today-via hydroelectric and timber projects, conservation initiatives, and housing developments-knowing their location is important for protecting cultural resources and for asserting the significance of Maidu participation in environmental stewardship. A GIS layer of Indian allotment lands in Plumas and Lassen counties, linked to quantitative and qualitative information from allotment files, offers a multileveled understanding of allotments. The mapping process engages dialogues in Participatory GIS (PGIS) and place-making, and raises key questions of power, representation, accessibility, and knowledge. The historic and contemporary contexts for mapping are addressed, and PGIS is evaluated as a tool for liberatory research with community groups.	10.1215/00141801-2010-002	2010
363	This review examines emerging research on the geoweb, particularly recent efforts to assess the social, political and disciplinary shifts associated with it. The rise of the geoweb is associated with shifts in the processes and power relations of spatial data creation and use, reconfigurations in previously bounded disciplinary knowledge sets, and shifts in the subjectivities and social relations that are produced through the geoweb's technologies, data, and practices. This early research on the societal implications of the geoweb is drawing productively upon conceptual frameworks from critical GIS, public participation GIS, and spatial data infrastructure research, but must also theorize beyond these existing bodies of work.	10.1177/0309132509340711	2010
376	Significant advances in public participation geographic information systems technology and online mapping platforms have not translated into enhanced citizen participation in democratic planning processes. This study contributes to addressing this gap by evaluating the engagement of members of an urban community in sustainable neighbourhood planning through argumentation mapping. The study provided an online public discussion forum, together with a neighbourhood map to which the participants could link their discussion contributions. On the basis of participation statistics, contents of contributions, and responses to a survey, we discuss the participants' technical and engagement experiences. The sixteen registered participants lived within or near the 'Queen West Triangle' in downtown Toronto, Canada. They rated themselves as experienced computer users and consequently found the participation in the online discussion forum to be easy. The contributions showed a great degree of interest and knowledge in the issues of sustainable community development. However, while the majority of participants also rated themselves as comfortable with map reading, they found the handling of the online neighbourhood map difficult and did not use the option to link their comments to the map.	10.1068/b34084	2009
364	Background: Extensive public health gains have benefited high-income countries in recent decades, however, citizens of low and middle-income countries (LMIC) have largely not enjoyed the same advancements. This is in part due to the fact that public health data - the foundation for public health advances - are rarely collected in many LMIC. Injury data are particularly scarce in many low-resource settings, despite the huge associated burden of morbidity and mortality. Advances in freely-accessible and easy-to-use information and communication (ICT) technology may provide the impetus for increased public health data collection in settings with limited financial and personnel resources. Methods and Results: A pilot study was conducted at a hospital in Cape Town, South Africa to assess the utility and feasibility of using free (non-licensed), and easy-to-use Social Web and GeoWeb tools for injury surveillance in low-resource settings. Data entry, geocoding, data exploration, and data visualization were successfully conducted using these technologies, including Google Spreadsheet, Mapalist, BatchGeocode, and Google Earth. Conclusion: This study examined the potential for Social Web and GeoWeb technologies to contribute to public health data collection and analysis in low-resource settings through an injury surveillance pilot study conducted in Cape Town, South Africa. The success of this study illustrates the great potential for these technologies to be leveraged for public health surveillance in resource-constrained environments, given their ease-of-use and low-cost, and the sharing and collaboration capabilities they afford. The possibilities and potential limitations of these technologies are discussed in relation to the study, and to the field of public health in general.	10.1186/1476-072X-9-25	2010
365	Travel to and from school is a regular part of life for most children. Such movement can also have important social, economic, and environmental implications, both for individuals and for wider society. This paper uses innovative methods to examine the complexity of the school journey, and to relate it to exposure to air pollution and engagement with the environment through which children pass. Some thirty lower secondary school pupils used mobile-phone and global positioning system technology to record their routes to and from school in four study periods. They were asked to take photographs and write text messages relating to their route, and these data were then linked to modelled air pollution on the routes through which pupils travelled. Results demonstrate that for most children the journey to and from school is highly variable and contingent on other factors. Pupils who travelled independently (on foot, by bicycle, or by bus) were most likely to engage with their immediate environment, and small variations in route choice had significant effects on their cumulative exposure to air pollution. It is argued that the results shed new light on the everyday experience of the school journey, and have implications for health promotion and transport planning in towns.	10.1068/a41405	2010
366	The oceans are not only being transformed through privatization as management moves towards market mechanisms, the oceans are also being \\zoned\\", with zoning increasingly proposed as the ideal conduit for weighting different uses of the ocean This is concomitant with a move towards ecosystem-based management that also partakes in a policy environment imbued with the commodification of nature, in which environmental services are ranked and valued according to neoliberal percept. Crucial to these projects are the utilization of GIS technologies This paper considers these zones of preservation and sites of conflict through an ethnographic case study of (lie scallop fisheries of New England, examining conflicts between harvesters, different projects to map the fishery, and ongoing efforts to reseed scallop beds The paper explores how participants themselves articulate the changing practices of fishing and farming, redefining boundaries of nature and Culture. While reseeding projects, for example, arguably participate in the market logic of neoliberalism, at the same time they may resist and redefine the terms, as communities see themselves sowing the seeds of their own sustainability and changing the terms of what Counts, literally, as nature Published by Elsevier Ltd"	10.1016/j.geoforum.2009.10.008	2010
367	A number of approaches for integrating GIS and qualitative research have emerged in recent years, as part of a resurgence of interest in mixed methods research in geography. These efforts to integrate qualitative data and qualitative analysis techniques complement a longstanding focus in GIScience upon ways of handling qualitative forms of spatial data and reasoning in digital environments, and extend engagements with 'the qualitative' in GIScience to include discussions of research methodologies. This article contributes to these emerging qualitative GIS methodologies by describing the structures and functions of 'computer-aided qualitative GIS' (CAQ-GIS), an approach for storing and analyzing qualitative, quantitative, and geovisual data in both GIS and computer aided data analysis software. CAQ-GIS uses modified structures from conventional desktop GIS to support storage of qualitative data and analytical codes, together with a parallel coding and analysis process carried out with GIS and a computer-aided data analysis software package. The inductive mixed methods analysis potential of CAQ-GIS is demonstrated with examples from research on children's urban geographies.	10.1111/j.1467-9671.2009.01182.x	2010
368	As the obesity epidemic in children increases, it is important to consider the role of neighborhoods in supporting children's physical activity and healthy development, especially in low-income communities where obesity levels among children are higher than for their middle-income counterparts. I present a participatory and qualitative GIS approach to mapping children's own perceptions and use of their neighborhood for physical activity with ten and eleven year-olds growing up in a diverse low-income community in Denver, CO. Girls walk shorter distances to and use different types of community spaces for play and recreation from boys, some of which is explained by the differing environmental-socialization approaches employed by parents and carers. Children's perceptions of risk align spatially with features of the built environment, but do not correlate with reported crime. Results illustrate the utility of qualitative spatial analysis to understand relationships between children's perception, the built environment, and social factors that shape children's active transport, leisure, and recreation in their neighborhood. Children's local knowledge should be valued and solicited in community-level health and planning interventions to promote physical activity.	10.1068/b35002	2010
369	This article presents an innovative approach to citizen-led production of Web-based geographic information where new and/or existing digital map features are linked to annotations or commentary and citizens engage in synchronous and/or asynchronous discussion. The article discusses the relationship of the approach to public participation geographic information systems (PPGISs) and the emerging challenges associated with volunteered geographic information. A custom-developed, open source software tool named MapChat is used to facilitate the citizen inputs and discussions. The information generated from applying the approach through a series of community workshops is presented and discussed in light of current issues in PPGIS and volunteered geographic information research.	10.1080/13658810903213288	2010
370	To increase the monitoring potential of forest fires, an alert classification methodology using satellite-mapped hotspots has been established to help forest managers in the prioritization of which hotspot to be verified in the field, thus potentially improving the distribution of fire-fighting resources. A computer application was developed based on web-distributed geographical information technology whose main function is to interact automatically generated satellite hotspots and risk areas indicated in fire-susceptibility maps and classify them into five alert levels. The location of the hotspots is available continuously every 4 h, and a susceptibility map is produced daily through map algebra algorithm, which uses static (topography, vegetation and land use) and dynamic (weather) variables. Every process runs through automated geoprocessing routines. The methodology was tested during the dry period of 2007 in the Carajas National Forest, in the Brazilian Amazon, within an area of 400,000 ha. It is a critical area constantly threatened by fires caused by invasions and deforestation owing to intense agribusiness advances and mining activities in its surroundings. This situation results in observations of many hotspots inside the study area for the same day and almost the same time period, in places of extreme opposites, demanding complex rapid analysis and hindering the decision of the displacement of fire-fighting teams. Further, a major mining company operates within the National Forest area, maintaining actions of protection as part of its environmental mining license. Results are presented under three aspects: (i) the credibility of the daily susceptibility map (algorithm), which showed strong correlation between areas of greatest risks and the confirmed forest fires; (ii) the reliability of hotspots (alert levels), confirming 71% of fires; (iii) accuracy in the decision of which hotspot to be checked, which revealed the same number of verifications at different alert levels, 82% confirmed alert 5 hotspots (maximum) and only 50% from alert 1 (minimum), resulting in faster fire-fighting actions, minimizing burned areas and, in some cases, allowing fire control before its spreading. Therefore, the methodology demonstrated that GIS routines are able to determine the relationship between a reality-based, interpreted susceptibility map of the area and satellite-generated hotspots, highlighting the ones of highest hazard level through the alert classification, becoming an important tool to help decisions from the fire-control center, especially for high-risk regions. The methodology may be extrapolated to other forested areas.	10.1080/13658810903194264	2010
371	Citizen science websites are emerging as a common way for volunteers to collect and report geographic ecological data. Engaging the public in citizen science is challenging and, when involving online participation, data entry, and map use, becomes even more daunting. Given these new challenges, citizen science websites must be easy to use, result in positive overall satisfaction for many different users, support many different tasks, and ensure data quality. To begin reaching these goals, we built a geospatially enabled citizen science website, evaluated its usability, and gained experience by working with and listening to citizens using the website. We sought to determine general perceptions, discover potential problems, and iteratively improve website features. Although the website was rated positively overall, map-based tasks identified a wide range of problems. Given our results, we redesigned the website, improved the content, enhanced the ease of use, simplified the map interface, and added features. We discuss citizen science websites in relation to online Public Participation Geographic Information Systems, examine the role(s) websites may play in the citizen science research model, discuss how citizen science research advances GIScience, and offer guidelines to improve citizen-based web mapping applications.	10.1080/13658816.2010.490532	2010
372	Tools that support public engagement with sustainability are essential for local sustainability planning. This research investigates the ability of two geographic information system (GIS)-based tools to promote discussion of sustainability in a suburban context. A local ecological footprint tool and a community environmental atlas (an environmentally themed online mapping system) were created for seven suburban boroughs of Montreal. Variations of both tools have been used to support sustainability efforts, but their use has not been widely evaluated. Working from a public participation GIS (PPGIS) framework that recognizes the powerful influence of data representation, this research uses focus groups to evaluate how well these tools address three criteria that have emerged from the literature on public engagement in sustainability: interdependency across systems, reflexivity about personal and social decision making, and interactions across spatial scales. Whereas the atlas remains advantageous for discussing local spatial specifics, it was found that the ecological footprint helped people see the interconnections among systems, integrate local and global aspects of sustainability, and reflect on the values and assumptions underlying current social and economic structures.	10.1080/00330120903404892	2010
373	The authors describe how we are harnessing the power of web 2.0 technologies to create new approaches to collecting, mapping, and sharing geocoded data. The authors begin with GMapCreator that lets users fashion new maps using Google Maps as a base. The authors then describe MapTube that enables users to archive maps and demonstrate how it can be used in a variety of contexts to share map information, to put existing maps into a form that can be shared, and to create new maps from the bottom-up using a combination of crowdcasting, crowdsourcing, and traditional broadcasting. The authors conclude by arguing that such tools are helping to define a neogeography that is essentially \\mapping for the masses,'' while noting that there are many issues of quality, accuracy, copyright, and trust that will influence the impact of these tools on map-based communication."	10.1177/0894439309332299	2009
374	The article explores qualitative geography and qualitative social science as sites of mixed methods research practice. The authors argue that there is an emergent convergence of methodologies and analytical purposes between qualitative geography and qualitative social science. The authors show how methodological and analytical convergence has been enabled by technological convergence between geographical information systems (GIS) and qualitative software (CAQDAS). The argument is illustrated by examples of convergent geo-referenced mixed methods studies, including a main example from research on reproductive health in Paraguay.	10.1177/1558689809344973	2009
375	Background: Measures to assess neighborhood environments are needed to better understand the salient features that may enhance outdoor physical activities, such as walking and bicycling for transport or leisure. The purpose of this study was to derive constructs to describe neighborhoods using both primary (neighborhood audit) and secondary (geographic information systems) data. Methods: We collected detailed information on 10,770 road segments using an audit and secondary data. The road segment sample was randomly split into an exploratory (60%) and validation sample (40%) for cross-validation. Using the exploratory sample (n = 6,388), seven a priori constructs were assessed separately (functionality, safety, aesthetics, destinations, incivilities, territorality, social spaces) by urbanicity using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Additionally, new a posteriori constructs were derived using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). For cross-validation (n = 4,382), we tested factor loadings, thresholds, correlated errors, and correlations among a posteriori constructs between the two subsamples. Two-week test-retest reliability of the final constructs using a subsample of road segments (n = 464) was examined using Spearman correlation coefficients. Results: CFA indicated the a priori constructs did not hold in this geographic area, with the exception of physical incivilities. Therefore, we used EFA to derive a four-factor solution on the exploratory sample: arterial or thoroughfare, walkable neighborhood, physical incivilities, and decoration. Using CFA on the validation sample, the internal validity for these a posteriori constructs was high (range 0.43 to 0.73) and the fit was acceptable. Spearman correlations indicated the arterial or thoroughfare factor displayed near perfect reliability in both urban and rural segments (r = 0.96). Both the physical incivilities factor and the walkable neighborhood factor had substantial to near perfect reliability in both urban and rural segments (r = 0.77 to 0.78 and r = 0.79 to 0.82, respectively). The decoration factor displayed moderate reliability in urban segments (r = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.38-0.60) and lower reliability in rural segments (r = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.25-0.52). Conclusion: The results of our analyses yielded four reliably and objectively measured constructs that will be used to explore associations with physical activity in urban and rural North Carolina. These constructs should be explored in other geographic areas to confirm their usefulness elsewhere.	10.1186/1479-5868-6-44	2009
377	This paper argues, following Friedrich Nietzsche, that recent evaluations of Google Earth uncritically privilege the product's Apollonian determinations at the expense of its Dionysian uncertainties. Specifically, when we understand Google Earth as a virtual globe composed of surveyed panoramas, sober rationalization, dystopic control, and transparent order - or, even, as a tool for participation and empowerment we undersell its capacities as an alluring digital peep-box, an uncertain orb spangled with vertiginous paranoia, frenzied navigation, jubilatory dissolution, and intoxicating giddiness. We argue that the former interpretations not only risk foreclosing our theorizations about how Google Earth is actually used in various ways and different contexts, they also reproduce a one-dimensional and conservative reading of technology that can be traced back (at least) to the writings of Theodor Adorno. By drawing on the work of Walter Benjamin (Adorno's critic and pen pal for more than a decade) we aim to 'go beyond Apollo and Adorno' by illustrating the extent to which Apollonian order and Dionysian love makes Google Earth go round. To do this, we examine Google Earth as a \\digital peep-box\\" with an online collective that revels in its \\"Spot the Black Helicopter\\" competitions  illuminated profanities  alien and giant insect invaders  naked sunbathers and crashed transport planes in Darfur.

378	Critical GIS (CGIS) is an approach to evaluating GIS technology that draws upon multiple intellectual tool kits-from geography, social theory and computing science. While its roots are in the battles between human geographers and GIScientists in the 1990s, CGIS has emerged as an independent, constructive approach to enhancing the power and appeal of GIS. CGIS is also beginning to gain acceptance as a legitimate component of the broad tent that is GIScience. This short article reviews the emergence of CGIS, discusses its influence on the discipline of GIScience and finally explores the state of CGIS in Canada.	NA	2009
379	Community integration research explores community contexts and factors that encourage or hinder individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) from actively participating in community life. This research agenda can be advanced by using mixed-methods that better document the relationships between contextual factors and individual experience. Two such methods were applied to a mixedmethods study of 40 adults with SMI living in independent housing in the Southeastern United States. Their contextualized experiences of community integration were measured by applying innovative participatory mapping and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping techniques. Use of these methods in conjunction with one another facilitated the creation of activity spaces, which can measure geographic accessibility and help to represent an individual's experience of place and degree of mobility. The utility of these newly applied methods for better understanding community integration for persons with SMI is explored and implications for using these measures in research and practice are discussed.

380	This article discusses the potential of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to become an information technology enabling groups of people to participate in decisions shaping their communities and promoting sustainable use of natural resources. It explains the concept of participation in the context of planning and decision making. In this context Participatory GIS (PGIS) offers tools that can be used to help the public become meaningfully involved in decision making processes affecting their communities. Following an overview of research on PGIS and its current status the article presents two recent studies of PGIS in water resource planning: one involving the use of computer generated maps representing simple information structures and the other involving the use of more sophisticated information tools. The synthesis of both studies provides the bases for discussing the prospects of PGIS to empower citizens in making decisions about their communities and resources. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

381	In spatial planning and environmental management, maps are found very helpful in many Situations, but in other situations they may also deepen conflicts or be ignored. This paper addresses the question what explains Such phenomena, with particular emphasis on, and reference to, collaborative policymaking settings in the Netherlands. We have elaborated the concept of 'frames' and 'framing' to structure and analyze the function of maps in the context of deliberative policymaking. With help of discourse analysis, a method adopted from the policy sciences, we have observed ongoing multi-actor processes and focused on discussions around maps in several case studies. From the observations of both the maps themselves and the discussions and actions with the maps, we have interpreted the meaning and frames represented 'in' the map images, as well as the various perspectives of actors 'on' the collaborative use of the map. We have conceptualized three fundamentally different perspectives or frames on the function of maps in the decision-making process. The cross-frame debate over maps is illustrated with the recollection of one particular map-making example. We conclude that the conflicts observed in a number of case Studies can be adequately explained with help of the three identified frames, and provide some recommendations for the profession of mapping.

420	In this paper I report on a participatory planning project undertaken in a community engaged in a ten-year revitalization effort. Working with several youth-serving organizations, a community planning project was conducted in which local youth collected qualitative data about their neighborhood through a variety of techniques (photography, drawings, narratives). The project took place against the backdrop of an emerging neighborhood indicators geographical information system (GIS) aimed at tracking the impact of the revitalization effort. Although techniques for collecting and using qualitative data have matured during several decades of use in the field of participatory planning and development, their effective incorporation into GIS remains elusive. Although few technical barriers remain, the absence of stakeholder participation and the lack of community capacity to implement a community-based GIS are important obstacles to a fully realized qualitative GIS. Drawing on the youth-development literature, I demonstrate in this case study the potential of qualitative GIS for engaging young people in participatory planning, while also highlighting the continuing challenge to its implementation.	10.1068/a3861	2006
383	The effectiveness of a decision-support tool created to identify protected-area potential within the Nova Forest Alliance (NFA) of Nova Scotia, Canada is assessed from the perspective of a public participatory geographic information system (PPGIS) approach. The application sought to create an integrated GIS-based decision-support tool for community-focused communication and conservation assessment among NFA partners (including private woodland owners, government agencies, forest companies, and non-government organizations) and potential application within other model forests in Canada. The application illustrated that the GIS-based tool, once set up and Populated with the necessary data, was able to generate effective visual alternatives to support decision making within the NFA community and elsewhere. However, from a PPGIS perspective, the application faced challenges that influenced the efficacy of its implementation: (1) limitations arose around data quality, use and sharing policies; (2) although opportunities for participation by the NFA partnership were initiated, these proved insufficient to achieve adequate engagement, buy in and Support for the process and outcomes; and (3) the expert-grounded GIS-based tool requires a greater degree of expertise than may currently be present in the community. These challenges limit its ongoing use in the NFA and its potential utility in other model forests. For PPGIS-decision-support applications to be effective in the NFA and elsewhere, it is suggested that the following conditions be met: (1) implementation of geographically based data policies to allow for greater data accessibility, specifically with fewer bureaucratic and private sector barriers: (2) engagement of community partners in the initial project design, goal-setting and subsequent stages, even if this requires extensions to anticipated timelines; and (3) development of effective participatory technical systems that meet the needs of participants without being so complex as to constitute a barrier to their use.

384	Cinema-going is a cultural experience shaped by logistics and mobility, as film distributors and exhibitors operate to enable films to be screened in places and at times when audiences can physically assemble to view them together A historical understanding of the geography of cinema distribution, exhibition and attendance can therefore help its to understand what factors other than the choice of film title may have shaped the experience of the cinema audience. This article uses samples of trade commentary on small country cinemas in the late 1920s from the Australian trade journal Everyones, and suggests that historical GIS maps could help its to understand regional differences in the cinema-going experience, or track phenomena such as the diffusion of racial and social segregation in cinemas. Nevertheless, we need to remain mindful of the limits of maps to adequately explain the cultural experience of encountering these phenomena.	NA	2009
385	The lack of solid footing in political space is what makes the human rights claims of refugees most vulnerable in the contemporary international order. However, modem international human rights law and protection are predicated on a spatialised sense of the subject of rights that is formed in opposition to and in exclusion of the refugee. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) seeks to locate refugees as part of the universe of human rights through refugee registration exercises; it attempts to map their displacement within the geography of emplaced citizenry. Its conventional efforts in this regard fail, though, and, rather, serve to illustrate how the informal international movement of refugees still exceeds and, thus, undermines the universalism of the UN vision of human rights and freedoms. Consequently, the UNHCR has recently resorted to the highly sophisticated computerised registration technology, called proGres, under its Project Profile system. While the detail and complexity of Project Profile allow for a mapping no more capable of accurately tracing the movements of refugees within the global geography of universal human rights, the complex of digitalised mapping systems brought together within Project Profile permit the production and performance of an international space in which humanitarians may expect refugees to fit. The force of the UNHCR`s new registration system is to produce a manner of spatialising refugees that can legitimate and moralise their constraint within orders of international politics and security which allow little room for response to the rights claims of refugees. Rather, their claims to human rights become foreclosed within a virtual understanding of human displacement with respect to emplacement in the state.	10.1068/d6807	2009

387	Modern nastroje k vyvoji interaktivnich webovych mapovych aplikaci pro vizualizaci prostorovych dat na internetu In the last few years has begun the development of dynamic web applications, often called Web2.0. From this development was created a technology called Mashups. Mashups may easily combine huge amounts of data sources and functionalities of existing as well as future web applications and services. Therefore they are used to develop a new device, which offers new possibilities of information usage. This technology provides possibilities of developing basic as well as robust web applications not only for IT or GIS specialists, but also for common users. Software companies have developed web projects for building mashup application also called mashup editors.	NA	2009
388	This paper focuses on the methods used in a project which set out to capture the movements and to consider the wellbeing of 30 teenagers on their journeys to and from school. A mobile phone linked to a GPS receiver was used to automatically log travel patterns whilst the respondents added 'blog' images and text about how they felt on the journey. Follow up interviews further explored the data. The paper shows that by using a range of methods the young people became involved in the project in different ways providing a rich picture of contingent and complex school journeys.	10.1080/14733280902798829	2009
389	This study examines the potential socio-spatial impacts of a new series of marine protected areas (MPAs) on fishers in Moorea, French Polynesia. The establishment of the MPAs is contextualized within recent and historical processes of economic development and theories of women in development and gender, culture and development. Seventy adults from three neighborhoods in Moorea were interviewed. Analysis of the data provides new information about the characteristics of fishing in Moorea. Unlike most fishing cultures and communities throughout the Pacific Islands, men and women in Moorea have similar, as opposed to segregated, spatial patterns of fishing activities and fishing methods. The study also points out the potential negative impacts of the MPAs on both men and women, particularly younger and lower-income fishers.	10.1080/09663690903003983	2009
421	We discuss locations as defined by their qualitative spatial relations to other features, dubbed qualitative locations (QL). We further propose a mechanism to handle queries with qualitative locations in geospatial information systems. For the realization of the mechanism for QL-based queries, we propose a conceptual framework that takes advantage of models of qualitative spatial reasoning to bridge the gap between conventional metric spatial information systems and the general public's common-sense query of spatial relations in natural language.

390	Rainfall erosivity is a major causal factor of soil erosion, and it is included in many prediction models. Maps of rainfall erosivity indices are required for assessing soil erosion at the regional scale. In this study a comparison is made between several techniques for mapping the rainfall erosivity indices: i) the RUSLE R factor and ii) the average EI(30) index of the erosive events over the Ebro basin (NE Spain). A spatially dense precipitation data base with a high temporal resolution (15 min) was used. Global, local and geostatistical interpolation techniques were employed to produce maps of the rainfall erosivity indices, as well as mixed methods. To determine the reliability of the maps several goodness-of-fit and error statistics were computed, using a cross-validation scheme, as well as the uncertainty of the predictions, modeled by Gaussian geostatistical simulation. All methods were able to capture the general spatial pattern of both erosivity indices. The semivariogram analysis revealed that spatial autocorrelation only affected at distances of similar to 15 km around the observatories. Therefore, local interpolation techniques tended to be better overall considering the validation statistics. All models showed high uncertainty, caused by the high variability of rainfall erosivity indices both in time and space, what stresses the importance of having long data series with a dense spatial coverage.

391	The cadastre is an infrastructure of institutions, humans, and nonhumans. Its role in governance is the provision of a systematic organization of land ownership, rights, and responsibilities. The cadastral infrastructure's information needs to correspond to actual uses of land if it is to be of continued use in governance. In effect, as an important governmental information space, it needs to also correspond to geographic and social spaces. For many reasons the boundary objects making up the cadastral infrastructure can be unstable-delays in processing changes and conflicting competencies are commonplace. Larger instabilities including civil unrest, war, and persistent corruption produce profound asymmetries and distortions. Following centuries of disruption, ongoing attempts to augment cadastral infrastructures in post-socialist Central and Eastern Europe offer opportunities to probe and analyze the stabilization of cadastral infrastructures. Poland, which never saw complete collectivization and retained a cadastral infrastructure, offers an exemplary cadastral infrastructure for study, with its uniqueness bringing out many tensions still nascent in neighboring countries.	10.1080/01972240903212623	2009
392	The majority of research on the information revolution in Korea focuses exclusively on the 1990s, disregarding previous historical periods, claiming that decade marked the beginning of an \\information society.\\" This article, on the other hand, adopts a wider, sociohistorical perspective on urban mobility and mobile communication technologies in the Korean context. By doing so, it recontextualizes the shifting relationship between mobile communication technologies and urban mobility and provides insights into how the modern social geography of mobility in Seoul is being constantly made and remade. In particular, the article focuses upon the social space of bang ( literally \\"room\\" in Korean) as a product of the specific modern spatial rearrangement of the public and the private. It examines how the organizing principles of social spaces are moving from enclosure and containment to connection and distribution."	10.1080/01972240903213100	2009
393	Recent attempts to integrate geographic information systems (GIS) and participatory techniques, have given rise to terminologies such as participatory GIS and community-integrated GIS. Although GIS was initially developed for physical geographic application, it can be used for the management and analysis of health and health care data. Geographic information, systems, combined with participatory methodology, have facilitated the analysis of access to health facilities and disease risk in different populations. Little has been, published about the usefulness of combining participatory methodologies and GIS technology in an effort to understand and inform, community-based intervention studies, especially in. the context of HIV This article attempts to address this perceived gap in the literature. The authors describe the application of participatory research methods with GIS in the formative phase of a multisite community-based social mobilization trial, using voluntary counseling and testing and post-test support as the intervention.

395	Heated exchanges between critical theorists and GIScientists over geographic information systems ( GIS) in 1990s geography gave rise to calls for increased communication between critics and practitioners of the technology and most recently for \\hybrid\\" qualitative-quantitative GIS practices. Although GIS scholars have successfully addressed mid-1990s critiques of the technology by developing a series of critical GIS practices that involve nuanced and reflexive deployments of GIS and assessments of its visual products, theoretical critiques of GIS remain fixated on the epistemological deficiencies of the technology. Despite references to loosening metaphysical tensions across the discipline, this difference in assessments reveals the discourses of critical-theoretic geography and GIScience to remain separated by a trenchant philosophical divide, across which ontological and epistemological commitments are inviolable. The inability to fully reconcile a critical-theoretic epistemology with the explicitly ontological metaphysics of GIS further complicates qualitative engagements with the technology by addressing a series of inconsistencies into GIS praxis arising from the quantitative limits to representation encountered in the formal universe of computing. The persistence of metaphysical tensions in critical engagements with the technology questions the degree to which qualitative methods can be seamlessly hybridized with the quantitative architectures of GIS."	10.1080/00330120902932026	2009
396	Context. Some species that are perceived by certain stakeholders as a valuable resource can also cause ecological or economic damage, leading to contrasting management objectives and subsequent conflict between stakeholder groups. There is increasing recognition that the integration of stakeholder knowledge with formal scientific data can enhance the information available for use in management. This is especially true where scientific understanding is incomplete, as is frequently the case for wide-ranging species, which can be difficult to monitor directly at the landscape scale. Aims. The aim of the research was to incorporate stakeholder knowledge with data derived from formal quantitative models to modify predictions of wildlife distribution and abundance, using wild deer in the UK as an example. Methods. We use selected predictor variables from a deer-vehicle collision model to estimate deer densities at the 10-km square level throughout the East of England. With these predictions as a baseline, we illustrate the use of participatory GIS as a methodological framework for enabling stakeholder participation in the refinement of landscape-scale deer abundance maps. Key results. Stakeholder participation resulted in modi. cations to modelled abundance patterns for all wild deer species present in the East of England, although the modi. cations were minor and there was a high degree of consistency among stakeholders in the adjustments made. For muntjac, roe and fallow deer, the majority of stakeholder changes represented an increase in density, suggesting that populations of these species are increasing in the region. Conclusions. Our results show that participatory GIS is a useful technique for enabling stakeholders to contribute to incomplete scientific knowledge, especially where up-to-date species distribution and abundance data are needed to inform wildlife research and management. Implications. The results of the present study will serve as a valuable information base for future research on deer management in the region. The flexibility of the approach makes it applicable to a range of species at different spatial scales and other wildlife conflict issues. These may include the management of invasive species or the conservation of threatened species, where accurate spatial data and enhanced community involvement are necessary in order to facilitate effective management.	10.1071/WR08153	2009
397	Previous soil lead studies in New Orleans focused on the geochemical footprint and its health impacts. This study examines the human geography of race, income, and age in pre-Katrina metropolitan New Orleans within the context of lead accumulation in soils. Sample points of soil lead data (n = 5,467) collected in 1998-2000 were mapped in a geographic information system (GIS), binned into 9 ranges, and queried by (1) 2000 Census racial demographic data, (2) 1999 median household income, and (3) 2000 age data. The absolute population generally declines as lead levels increase except at lead levels from 200-400 to 400-1,000 mg/kg when population increases; the African-American population comprises a disproportionate share of this cohort. The high-lead areas occur in the inner city, home to the largest populations of African-Americans in New Orleans. The mean household income curve indicates that lower economic groups are at risk to higher levels of lead. A total of 44,701 children under the age of 5 years, plus 123,579 children aged 5-17, lived in census block groups containing at least one sample point with over 100 mg/kg lead, and these include 23,124 and 64,064 young people, respectively, who live near at least one point over 400 mg/kg. Lead exposure affects a panoply of outcomes that influence the health and welfare of the community. Unless corrected, children are likely to return to the same or, because of lack of lead-safe practices during renovation, even higher exposure risks than before the flooding of New Orleans.	10.1007/s10653-008-9190-9	2008
398	This research seeks to contribute to advancing qualitative methodologies at the intersection of qualitative geographic information systems (GIS), narrative analysis, 3D GIS-based time-geographic methods, and computer-aided qualitative data analysis. The approach to GIS-based narrative analysis developed in the study, called \\geo-narrative,\\" is based on extending current GIS capabilities for the analysis and interpretation of narrative materials such as oral histories, life histories, and biographies. The three central elements in this approach are (1) narrative analysis as the qualitative approach  (2) 3D GIS-based time-geographic methods as the representational framework  and (3) 3D-VQGIS as the GIS-based computer-aided qualitative data analysis component. A case example based on a study of the lives of the Muslim women in Columbus, Ohio, after 11 September 2001 is used to illustrate the approach."	10.1080/00330120802211752	2008
399	Wildland fire creates a complex relationship between federal agencies and public stakeholders. Questions surrounding the public's role in federal wildland fire management point to broader questions about the relationships among scientists, policymakers, federal agencies, and the public. In this article we report on a project to provide information about the key components of federal policies that govern wildland. re management. The goal is to enhance the decision support capabilities of a geographic information system (GIS)-based fire risk model and the capacity of users to interpret the outputs of the model from a. re policy perspective. We conclude by making recommendations for how this and other such tools might be refined to improve and expand policy interactions among government land and resource management agencies, scientists, and the public.	10.1080/00330120802211836	2008
400	Despite growing interest in urbanization and its social and ecological impacts on formerly rural areas, empirical research remains limited. Extant studies largely focus either on issues of social exclusion and enclosure or ecological change. This article uses the case of sweetgrass basketmaking in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, to explore the implications of urbanization, including gentrification, for the distribution and accessibility of sweetgrass, an economically important nontimber forest product (NTFP) for historically African American communities, in this rapidly growing area. We explore the usefulness of grounded visualization for research efforts that are examining the existence of \\fringe ecologies\\" associated with NTFP. Our findings highlight the importance of integrated qualitative and quantitative analyses for revealing the complex social and ecological changes that accompany both urbanization and rural gentrification."	10.1080/00330120802288941	2008
401	This paper examines the increasing use of geographic information systems (GIS) to support the project of 'collaborative' planning. Specifically, I explore the ways in which the use of GIS in collaborative planning programs works to counteract and/or reproduce patterns of marginalization always present in local political struggles. Through a review of the literature and an analysis of a case study of the use of GIS in rural water resource management, I argue that the discourse and practices of collaboration can often lead to a problematic depoliticization of GIS. Furthermore, I show how this depoliticization can normalize both uneven power dynamics and the marginalization of alternative and oppositional perspectives. I employ this case study as a backdrop to propose an alternative practice of participatory GIS motivated by Mouffe's notion of 'agonistic pluralism'. This practice of agonistic participatory GIS is designed to foreground, rather than obscure, the politics of spatial knowledge production by explicitly juxtaposing alternative understandings of space and spatial problems. I conclude by discussing the importance of this work to the critical and participatory GIS research agendas.	10.1068/a4028	2008
402	Recent developments in air pollution epidemiology are generating new data on human air pollution exposure and health effects in the city. Based on regression mapping or land use regression (LUR), these data also provide a new window on the urban political ecology of scale. Air pollution itself is understudied in the emergent urban political ecology literature and in this case it is aided by - indeed must rely upon - GIS/spatial analysis. A case study of Vancouver illustrates the scalar contradictions in regulatory versus LUR measurements and estimates leading us finally to consider the wider implications for urban political ecology and environmental governance.	10.1111/j.1475-5661.2008.00316.x	2008
408	Traffic is a major source of air pollutants in urban environments, and exposure to these pollutants may be associated with adverse health effects. However, inconsistencies in observational epidemiological studies may be caused by differential measurement errors in various approaches in assessing exposure. We aimed to evaluate a simple method for assessing outdoor air pollutant concentrations in Oslo, Norway, through a land-use regression method. Samples of nitrogen oxides (NOx) were collected in two different weeks using Ogawa passive diffusion samplers simultaneously at 80 locations across Oslo. Independent variables used in subsequent regression models as predictors of the pollutants were derived using the Arc 9 geographic information system (GIS) software. indicators of land use, traffic, population density, and physical geography were tested. The final regression model yielded an adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.77 for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 0.66 for nitric oxide (NO), and 0.73 for NOx. The results suggest that a good predictive exposure model can be derived from this approach, which can be used to estimate long-term small-area variation in concentrations for individual exposure assessment in epidemiological studies in a highly cost-effective way. These small-area variations in traffic pollution are important since they may have associations with health effects. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	10.1016/j.atmosenv.2007.05.039	2007
403	One of the greatest challenges facing mountain scholars is to separate environmental change caused by human activities from change that would have occurred without human interference. Linking cause and effect is especially difficult in Mountain regions where physical processes can operate at ferocious rates and ecosystems are sensitive to rapid degradation by climate change and resource development. In addition, highland inhabitants are more Vulnerable to natural hazards and political-economic marginalization than Populations elsewhere. This address focuses on the Nanga Parbat massif in the Himalaya Range of Pakistan, Garhwal Himalaya of northwest India, and Manaslu-Ganesh Himals of central Nepal. I have highlighted three special insights that geographers offer to increase understanding of human impacts on the stability of mountain landscapes. First, the mixed methods and theories we employ-quantitative and qualitative, postpositivist science and social theory, muddy-boots fieldwork linked with GIScience-together position geographers to resolve the debate over human-triggered changes in the physical landscape in mountains and explain the frequent disconnect between mountain science, policymaking, and resource management. Second, academic scholars and policymakers have come to realize that most problems require training, experience, and expertise in understanding physical and human systems. Third, modern techniques of measuring rates of geomorphic change help place the human factor in perspective and explain spatial variability of natural hazards. Forecasting environmental change remains elusive in \\the perfect landscape\\" of mountains."	10.1080/00045600802118491	2008
404	Public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) increasingly are utilized in geographic research, yet researchers rarely are provided with guidance on how to implement PPGIS in an appropriate and effective manner. This article reports on the process of research that explores responses to current and future local tourism development offered by a sample of residents using a modified PPGIS approach called 'community action geographic information system'(CAGIS). The conceptual development of CAGIS is reported and the challenges encountered during its implementation in Churchill, Manitoba during 2005-2007 are reviewed. It is suggested that researchers wishing to conduct similar research should undertake thorough preliminary fieldwork to assess the likelihood of funding agreement on a common problem; acquiring adequate resources; establishing collective responsibility for the project's outcome; attaining stakeholder support; developing trust and meaningful relationships; and incorporating indigenous knowledge appropriately. Feedback of results to community members also should be an integral part of the research process. A number of feedback mechanisms ore reported, including an interactive weblog, which helped facilitate communication between heterogeneous groups in Churchill. Although ambitions for a truly participatory GIS approach to this project have been set aside, it is held that PPGIS con yield positive outcomes for communities and academia. Sharing this research experience will be useful to others who venture into PPGIS research, especially in northern communities.	10.1111/j.1541-0064.2008.00217.x	2008
405	Technologies associated with the second-generation of the World-Wide Web enable virtually anyone to share their data, documents, observations, and opinions on the Internet. In less than three years, mapping platforms such as Google Maps have sparked an exponential growth in user-generated geographically referenced content. However, the \\serious\\" applications of Web 2.0 are sparse and this paper assesses its use in the context of collaborative spatial decision-making. We present an online map-based discussion forum that enables Internet users to submit place-based comments and respond to contributions from other participants. We further use the geographic references in a thread-based master plan debate for a university campus to simulate this debate in the map-based forum. This allows us to demonstrate how the online map provides an overview of the status and spatial foci of the debate, and how it can help us understand the spatial thought processes of the participants.

406	This paper investigates the unique challenges of an expanding group of stakeholders making demands upon shared geospatial data resources: non governmental organisations participating in local governance. In spite of efforts to improve local data integration in spatial data infrastructures and development of strategies from public participation GIS to expand access to geospatial data and technologies, grassroots data users still experience difficulties with the accessibility, quality, and usefulness of local government data resources. Drawing from extended ethnographic research conducted in Chicago, Illinois, I illustrate these problems and how they are shaped by grassroots groups' resource constraints, knowledge systems, and socio-political positions; and assess the feasibility and impacts of proposed alternatives for better meeting grassroots spatial data needs. I contend that the needs and challenges of these stakeholders are unique from those of other users, but are nonetheless rooted in central dilemmas of spatial data handling, and so might be addressed through stronger engagement with GIScience research in this arena.	10.1080/13658810701348971	2008
407	We propose and systematically formalise a dynamical spatial systems approach for the modelling of changing spatial environments. The formalisation adheres to the semantics of the situation calculus and includes a systematic account of key aspects that are necessary to realize a domain-independent qualitative spatial theory that may be utilised across diverse application domains. The spatial theory is primarily derivable from the all-pervasive generic notion of \\qualitative spatial calculi\\" that are representative of differing aspects of space. In addition, the theory also includes aspects, both ontological and phenomenal in nature, that are considered inherent in dynamic spatial systems. Foundational to the formalisation is a causal theory that adheres to the representational and computational semantics of the situation calculus. This foundational theory provides the necessary (general) mechanism required to represent and reason about changing spatial environments and also includes an account of the key fundamental epistemological issues concerning the frame and the ramification problems that arise whilst modelling change within such domains. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that based on the structure and semantics of the proposed framework, fundamental reasoning tasks such as projection and explanation directly follow. Within the specialised spatial reasoning domain, these translate to spatial planning/re-configuration, causal explanation and spatial simulation. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that alternate formalisations of existing qualitative spatial calculi using high-level tools such as the situation calculus are essential for their utilisation in diverse application domains such as intelligent systems, cognitive robotics and event-based GIS."	10.1080/13875860801926884	2008
409	A Participatory Geographical Information System (PGIS) has been developed recently to design and adapt Geographic Information System (GIS) that draws on the diversity of experiences associated with \\participatory development\\" and involves communities in the production of GIS data and spatial decision-making tools. Participatory approach in the development of GIS helps to develop local knowledge processes. This knowledge process creates a channel of coordination between local people and the experts. The paper deals with the possibility of using spatial maps in consultation with local communities to develop an effective and sustainable distribution planning to maximize as well as ensure safe water coverage for the arsenic (As) exposed population in Mattab Upazila in southeastern Bangladesh. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) methods along with GIS were used to obtain relevant information from the field. Participants from different focus-groups were asked to determine their \\"own priorities\\" for spatial planning of alternative As-safe drinking water options. The study reveals that about 70% of the alternative safe water options were distributed after consultation with people. These distributed options were found to be superimposed within the existing safe water buffer zones which otherwise could have been avoided and thus increased the safe water coverage if the spatial maps were also consulted before selection of final installation sites. The study based on the community perspectives on demand-based safe water options thus reveals the suitability of using PGIS techniques for rational distribution of safe water options. The process of participatory mapping within focus-groups further makes a platform to enhance information about community needs of suitable safe water options in the study area."	10.1080/10934520701567221	2007
410	Recent years have witnessed a burgeoning of applications of GIS which grant legitimacy to indigenous geographical knowledge as well as to 'official' spatial data. By incorporating various forms of community participation these newer framings of Geographical Information Systems as 'Participatory GIS' (PGIS) offer a response to the critiques of GIS which were prevalent in the 1990s. This paper reviews PGIS in the context of the 'democratization of GIS'. It explores aspects of the control and ownership of geographical information, representations of local and indigenous knowledge, scale and scaling up, web-based approaches and some potential future technical and academic directions.	10.1177/0309132507081493	2007
411	The public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) research agenda has explored the issue of equitable access and use of geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial data among traditionally marginalized citizens, in order to facilitate effective citizen participation in inner-city revitalization activities. However, prior research indicates that PPGIS is a complex process, with uneven outcomes. The author contends that such unevenness can be explained by use of a new theoretical framework drawn from the literature of politics of scale and networks. The author contends that the PPGIS process occurs in 'spaces of dependence', containing localized social relations and place-specific conditions. The politics of securing this space leads to the creation of 'spaces of engagement' at multiple scales. Within these spaces, networks of association evolve to connect multiple actors from public and private sectors with community organizations. Such networks can contain structural inequities, hierarchical dominance, and fluctuating resources. But these networks also transcend political boundaries and are dynamic and flexible, enabling individuals to manipulate and modify them. In trying to control the revitalization agendas and the material resources required, the actors and community organizations construct politics of scale. For some community organizations, such scalar politics and creative alliances with critical actors allow them to navigate territorially scaled networks of power skillfully in order to gain an effective voice in decisionmaking activities. But other community organizations lag behind, and are not able to form relationships in order to secure their urban space. By the use of new empirical data, coupled with a new theoretical framework, the author aims to contribute both to greater theorization and to better understanding of the uneven and contradictory nature of PPGIS processes.	10.1068/a38247	2007
412	In this paper, we introduce a family of expressive models for qualitative spatial reasoning with directions. The proposed family is based on the cognitive plausible cone-based model. We formally define the directional relations that can be expressed in each model of the family. Then, we use our formal framework to study two interesting problems: computing the inverse of a directional relation and composing two directional relations. For the composition operator, in particular, we concentrate on two commonly used definitions, namely, consistency-based and existential composition. Our formal framework allows us to prove that our solutions are correct. The presented solutions are handled in a uniform manner and apply to all of the models of the family.	10.1109/TKDE.2007.1046	2007
413	In many communities in northern Ghana, the environment has been altered by complex natural and human driven forces with significant impact on the lives of their inhabitants. The need to formulate an improved, holistic and consistent methodological approach to assess the problem is critical for sustainable natural resource management. This paper examines the potential of the DPSIR environmental assessment framework utilizing GIS-based participatory methodology in the assessment of environmental degradation in northern Ghana. Community truthing tools such as key informant interviews, focus group discussions, participant observation and participatory Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were employed as a means of soliciting societal responses integrated to conventional GIS spatial analysis to measure the indicators of the Driving force-Pressure-State-Impacts-Response (DPSIR) assessment framework. Post classification GIS imagery results show a marked natural vegetation decrease of 634 km2 (42%) of the study area with a corresponding increase of 600 km(2) (39%) of grasses and built-up and barren environment in the period of 14 years from 1990 to 2004. This is attributed to extreme climatic conditions and human driven causes such as poverty, population growth, migration and land tenure system. Poverty reduction strategies, amendment of the Mining and Mineral Law (PNDC law 153), improvement of the existing land tenure system and the control of migrants and Fulani herdsmen from neighbouring Burkina Faso were some of the solutions selected by the research participants, to be emphasized in the National Environmental Action Plan (EPA Act 490). This paper concludes that the DPSIR environmental assessment framework is an effective means of organizing complex environmental information to facilitate policy decision making.	10.1111/j.1477-8947.2007.00152.x	2007
414	Purpose: We examined the geographic bias of four methods of geocoding addresses using ArcGIS, commercial firm, SAS/GIS, and aerial photography. We compared \\point- in-polygon\\" (ArcGIS, commercial firm, and aerial photography) and the \\"look-up table\\" method (SAS/GIS) to allocate addresses to census geography, particularly as it relates to census-based poverty rates. Methods: We randomly selected 299 addresses of children treated for asthma at an urban emergency department (1999-2001). The coordinates of the building address side door were obtained by constant offset based on ArcGIS and a commercial firm and true ground location based on aerial photography. Results: Coordinates were available for 261 addresses across all methods. For 24% to 30% of geocoded road/door coordinates the positional error was 51 meters or greater, which was similar across geocoding methods. The mean bearing was -26.8 degrees for the vector of coordinates based on aerial photography and ArcGIS and 8.5 degrees for the vector based on aerial photography and the commercial firm (p < 0.0001). ArcGIS and the commercial firm performed very well relative to SAS/GIS in terms of allocation to census geography. For 20%, the door location based on aerial photography was assigned to a different block group compared to SAS/GIS. The block group poverty rate varied at least two standard deviations for 6% to 7% of addresses. Conclusion: We found important differences in distance and bearing between geocoding relative to aerial photography. Allocation of locations based on aerial photography to census-based geographic areas could lead to substantial errors."	10.1016/j.annepidem.2006.10.015	2007
415	This paper examines the relationships between place attachment and landscape values using two measures of place attachment-a psychometric, scale-based measure [Williams, D. R., & Vaske, J. J. (2003). The measurement of place attachment: Validity and generalisability of a psychometric approach. Forest Science, 49(6), 830-840] and a map-based measure derived from mapped special places [Brown, G. (2005). Mapping spatial attributes in survey research for natural resource management: Methods and applications. Society and Natural Resources, 18(l), 17-39]. We first examine the external validity of a two-dimensional, psychometric place attachment scale in Australia and its relationship with place-based landscape values. The place attachment scale and landscape value measures were included in a mail survey of residents and visitors to the Otways region (Victoria, Australia). Exploratory factor analysis of resident subgroups and visitors demonstrate the place attachment scale consists of two dimensions with high reliability. We use regression analysis to show that landscape importance values, especially spiritual and wilderness values, are significant predictors of the scale-based measure of place attachment. We then examine the relationship between a map-based measure of place attachment and landscape values. We use spatial cross-correlation and regression analyses to show that aesthetic, recreation, economic, spiritual, and therapeutic values spatially co-locate with special places and thus likely contribute to place attachment. We argue that survey mapping of landscape values and special places provides a reasonable proxy for scale-based measures of place attachment while providing richer, place-based information for land use planning. We conclude by introducing the concept of a map-based place attachment index and suggest that survey-based measures of landscape values and special places can be used to assess the risk associated with landscape modification. We provide a map showing one possible place attachment index for the Otways region and discuss its potential application. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	10.1016/j.apgeog.2006.11.002	2007
416	This article presents results of an empirical study about the use of a group-based geographic information system (GIS), called WaterGroup, developed as a collaborative spatial decision support system. WaterGroup was designed to enable stakeholder groups to participate in the solution of conjunctive water resource administration decision problems being addressed by the Idaho Department of Water Resources in the Boise River Basin of southwestern Idaho. The decision situation, software development, and empirical investigation are described within the context of other research activities/literatures related to group/community/public geographic information systems, helping us sort through the burgeoning terminology of this continually emerging field. We used Enhanced Adaptive Structuration Theory 2 to motivate research questions investigated by way of a field experiment research design. Decision process is characterized in terms of human-computer-human interaction coding. We used a technique called \\interaction coding\\" to compile three streams of data from videotapes as a record of interaction in two stakeholder-oriented decision workshops. Coded data are examined using nonparametric, exploratory sequential data analysis. Additionally, we used questionnaires to gather data regarding participant perceptions of WaterGroup and the decision process. The findings of this study indicate that different technology configurations foster a different balance between analytic and deliberative activities within phases of a conjunctive administration decision process. A low-technology, chauffeur-driven configuration in a phase encourages more deliberation, and a medium-technology, participant-driven configuration in a phase encourages more analysis. We discuss the findings and their implications for group-based GIS decision support. This article will be of interest to researchers involved in group-based GIS decision support software design, in empirical studies of stakeholder group-based decision support, and facilitators desiring to gain deeper insight into field settings involving group-based GIS decision support."	10.1111/j.1467-8306.2006.00512.x	2006
417	There have been several obstacles to an embrace of critical theoretical work in GIScience; chief among them is the barrier between conceptualization and formalization. Early critics of the technology were not cognizant that technological change must be implemented within the language of code. While critics expressed their concerns in a theoretical and esoteric language, increasingly GIScientists are at pains to address the same issues so that solutions can be incorporated into software technologies. Indeed an implicit recognition of the important divide between informal and formal environments has aided GIScience researchers in developing strategies to represent multiple epistemologies in GIS. The article begins with a review of early critical GIScience, examines the degree of its acceptance in the light of a content analysis of GIS journals, and then illustrates that the issue of multiple representation of the same reality is being addressed under the rubric of ontologies. New research in this area has had significant impact on GIScience because it has been articulated and addressed at both the conceptual and formal stages-a criterion for real changes to both GISystems and GIScience. The article concludes with an examination of why critical GIS remains relevant to the discipline, in spite of efforts to address issues of representation within GIScience.	10.1111/j.1467-8306.2006.00513.x	2006

419	Our purpose in this paper is to conceptualize and demonstrate an integrated analytical method for using both qualitative and quantitative data through geographic information systems (GIS) and ethnography. We acknowledge that the use of both types of data has been possible in GIS for some time, particularly for representation purposes. However, a recursive integration of different forms of data at the analysis level has been less explored and minimally theorized. Drawing on recent work in critical GIS and feminist perspectives, we suggest that visualization offers a strong technique for this effort but we approach it from the analytical base of grounded theory. Thus, we present an example of how grounded theory and visualization might be used together to construct an integrated analysis strategy that is both iterative and reflexive, both contextual and conceptual. We use Knigge's work on community gardens in Buffalo, New York, to provide a substantive example of the proposed methods.	10.1068/a37327	2006
440	Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) is a field of research that, among other things, focuses on the use of GIS by non-experts and occasional users. These users tend to have a diverse range of computer literacy, world views, cultural backgrounds and knowledge. These aspects require that the systems used within PPGIS are accessible and easy to use. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the related usability evaluation techniques focus on how to make computer systems more accessible, while focusing on user needs and requirements. Thus, the synergy between PPGIS and HCI seems natural. In this paper, we discuss the aspects of this synergy, building on our experience from three workshops. We demonstrate how usability evaluation can contribute to PPGIS research, and how PPGIS research can contribute to the HCI aspects of GIS in general. We conclude this paper with a call for a user-centred design approach to PPGIS projects.	10.1080/1365881031000114107	2003
422	The roles, relationships, and strategies of state and civil society institutions in urban planning, problem solving, and service delivery are in flux. In trying to understand how these changes affect community organizations, grassroots groups, and local-level institutions of civil society, existing research has tended to conceptualize these roles through a series of oppositional dialectics, such as cooptation or resistance. This article shows instead that community organizations shift their technological, institutional, and spatial approaches to urban planning and problem solving in creative and multifaceted ways. They produce a variety of spatial narratives to advance their agendas by strategically enacting multiple roles vis-a-vis a diverse set of actors and institutions. Information technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS) can play a central role in this approach. Community organizations apply their own interpretive frameworks to GIS-based maps and images to produce spatial narratives of local needs, conditions, and assets that may be adapted to the diverse roles and relationships they negotiate in urban spatial politics. These arguments are developed from ethnographic research carried out with two inner-city Chicago community organizations pursuing a range of neighborhood improvement activities.	10.1111/j.1467-8306.2006.00480.x	2006
423	The description models for spatial relations, especially those for direction relations, have gained increasing attention in GIS and Cartography community in recent decades. In this paper, such a quantitative model for spatial direction relations is discussed. It has been suggested that people often describe directions between two objects using multiple directions but not a single one; therefore a description model for direction relations should use multiple directions, i.e. direction group. A direction group consists of two components: the azimuths of the normals of direction Voronoi edges between two objects and the corresponding weights of the azimuths. The former can be calculated by means of Delaunay triangulation of the vertices and the points of intersection of the two objects; the latter can be calculated using the common areas of the two objects or the lengths of their direction Voronoi diagram (DVD) edges.The advantages of this model exist in four aspects: (1) direction computations are converted into a 1-dimension space problem and use lines (DVDs) to solve it, therefore direction computation process is simplified; (2) once Dir(A,B), the directions from A to B, is obtained, Dir(B,A) can be got without complex computations; (3) A quantitative direction group can be transformed into a qualitative one easily; (4) quantitative direction relations between objects can be recorded in 2-dimension tables, which is very useful in spatial reasoning.	10.1007/s10707-006-7578-1	2006
424	Although participatory approaches to geographic information system (GIS) use have significantly altered the technological and social practices of GIS-based research and decision making, they have received relatively little attention within discussions of participatory research. This paper examines how participation and representation are negotiated in participatory GIS research through everyday practices of knowledge production. Inclusion and exclusion in the production of knowledge in participatory GIS are mediated within several intersecting arenas of research practice simultaneously, often with contradictory implications, priorities, and outputs.	10.1111/j.1467-9272.2006.00526.x	2006
425	The RCC8 constraint language developed by Randell et al. has been popularly adopted by the Qualitative Spatial Reasoning and GIS communities. The recent observation that RCC8 composition table describes only weak composition instead of composition raises questions about Renz and Nebel's maximality results about the computational complexity of reasoning with RCC8. This paper shows that any consistent RCC8 binary constraint network (RCC8 network for short) can be consistently extended. Given Theta, an RCC8 network, and z, a fresh variable, suppose xTy is an element of Theta and T is contained in the weak composition of R and S. This means that we can add two new constraints xRz and zSy to Theta without changing the consistency of the network. The result guarantees the applicability to RCC8 of one key technique, (Theorem 5) of [J. Renz, B. Nebel, On the complexity of qualitative spatial reasoning: A maximal tractable fragment of the Region Connection Calculus. Artificial Intelligence 108 (1999) 69-123], which allows the transfer of tractability of a set of RCC8 relations to its closure under composition, intersection, and converse. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

426	This study examines altitudinal residential segregation by race in 146 cities in the U.S. South. It begins by embedding the topic in recent theorizations of the social construction of nature, the geography of race, and environmental justice. Second, it focuses on how housing markets, particularly in the South, tend to segregate minorities in low-lying, flood-prone, and amenity-poor segments of urban areas. It tests empirically the hypothesis that blacks are disproportionately concentrated in lower-altitude areas using GIs to correlate race and elevation by digital elevation-model block group within each city in 1990 and 2000. The statistical results confirm the suspected trend. A map of coefficients indicates strong positive associations in cities in the interior South-where the hypothesis is confirmed-and an inverse relationship near the coast, where whites dominate higher-valued coastal properties. Selected city case studies demonstrate these relationships connecting the broad dynamics of racial segregation to the particularities of individual places.	NA	2006
427	Although there is some research on lesbian sexuality and space I contend that such analyses do not account for the ways in which lesbian parent families' actions and subjectivities are structured through the time-space nexus. The particularities of mothers' management of their maternal-sexual identities remain uncharted. In this article I interrogate how lesbian parent families negotiate everyday places, such as the street and schools and how they inhabit and produce space. I address their dis-location within academic studies, situating the home as critical in lesbian parents' consolidation of self. Home represents one of the few places where the sexual and maternal identities of lesbian parents may be reconciled. I suggest that the multiple identifications and subject positions of lesbian mothers and their families need to be acknowledged so that they may be included within the queer cartography of lesbian and gay space. The data cited in this article come from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 18 lesbian mothers and 13 of their children, who live across the Yorkshire region in the United Kingdom.	10.1080/09663690500356768	2005
428	This paper critically reviews and analyses participatory GIS (PGIS) and participatory mapping applications within participatory spatial planning for community-based natural resource management in developing countries. There is an often implicit assumption that PGIS use is effective, in that it meets content needs, satisfies underlying local stakeholder interests and therefore is a tool for better governance. The analytical framework looks at participatory spatial planning performance with respect to key dimensions of governance, especially the intensity of community participation and empowerment, equity within communities and between 'governed' and 'governing', respect for indigenous knowledge, rights, ownership, legitimacy, and effectiveness. Specific development focus is given by a case study using participatory mapping and PGIS in community forest legitimization, planning and management in Tinto, Cameroon. 'Good governance' criteria are applied ex-post to the implementation procedures, the geoinformation outputs, and the longer-term outcomes of the PGIS processes. impacts of incorporating PGIS were examined in terms of the types and degrees of participation in the process; access to, and the uses made of, the geographic information; whether the information outputs met stakeholders' requirements; and the overall changes in equity and empowerment in the community. It was found that PGIS/participatory mapping processes contributed - positively, though not comprehensively - to good governance, by improving dialogue, redistributing resource access and control rights - though not always equitably - legitimizing and Using local knowledge, exposing local stakeholders to geospatial analysis, and creating some actor empowerment through training. PGIS promoted empowerment by supporting community members' participation in decision-making and actions, and by enabling land use planning decisions beyond community forestry itself.	10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00173.x	2005
429	Qualitative spatial reasoning forms an important part of the commonsense reasoning required for building intelligent Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Previous research has come up with models to capture cardinal direction relations for typical GIS data. In this paper, we target the problem of efficiently computing the cardinal direction relations between regions that are composed of sets of polygons and present two algorithms for this task. The first of the proposed algorithms is purely qualitative and computes, in linear time, the cardinal direction relations between the input regions. The second has a quantitative aspect and computes, also in linear time, the cardinal direction relations with percentages between the input regions. Our experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed algorithms outperform existing methodologies. The algorithms have been implemented and embedded in an actual system, CARDIRECT, that allows the user to 1) specify and annotate regions of interest in an image or a map, 2) compute cardinal direction relations between them, and 3) pose queries in order to retrieve combinations of interesting regions.	10.1109/TKDE.2005.192	2005
430	It has long been recognized that information technology (IT) can facilitate (or even permit) forms of empirical analysis unimagined just a generation ago. However, political scientists have generally experimented with only a narrow range of the possibilities the new technologies offer - easier writing, editing and communications processes, and more sophisticated statistical analyses. While these have undoubtedly increased productivity and rigor within the discipline, other IT applications have largely gone unnoticed. The growing pool of Computer-Aided Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) technologies presents researchers with new ways to conceptualize, perceive, and communicate their research, with the potential of revolutionizing social science research. This paper offers an overview of those IT and CAQDAS solutions with the most potential to facilitate political inquiry, and offers a series of practical steps by which technological novices might begin to apply the new technologies in their research. In closing, we discuss the benefits and perils of using such technology, and suggest the ways by which IT might strengthen current research techniques. The appendix catalogues several dozen applications for data acquisition, organization, processing, analysis and presentation, with contact and pricing information.	10.1007/s11135-005-3149-z	2005

432	This article examines survival strategies of urban households in post-socialist cities during the transition from the Soviet system to a market economy. The article links the outcomes of systemic transformation to the daily lives of households and connects urban change induced by mass privatization to class and gender processes inside the households. These \\other transitions\\" in everyday class and gender processes are consistently overlooked by macroeconomic approaches that dominate among transition theorists and policy consultants. The focus is on households in a Moscow neighborhood who attempt to meet the competing demands of earning income, fulfilling domestic responsibilities, and securing child care in a rapidly changing urban context. The diverse formal and informal economic practices of households are analyzed using the model of \\"multiple economies\\" that include paid work, informal work for cash, unpaid domestic labor, and help in kind, labor, and cash from networks of extended family, friends, and neighbors. Mapping the typically invisible transformations of multiple economies of households contributes to creating alternative geographies of transition that are rooted in daily household experiences, acknowledges the existence of multiple economies practices, and emphasizes their importance for household social reproduction. The research combined qualitative interviewing with GIS (geographic information systems) in order to develop the model of multiple economies, elicit household perspectives on urban change, and provide the information for mapping of the landscape of multiple economies. GIS was also used to understand the dynamics of local urban change resulting from privatization."	10.1111/j.1467-8306.2004.09402011.x	2004
433	A distinguishing feature of conservation planning and analysis methods is that they generally rely on biological assessments carried out using scientific sampling protocols and methodologies. Few conservation planning methods explicitly include what is variably described as values, understanding and perceptions. In this study, we examine the potential use of local values of biological resources in conservation planning by comparing this with scientific biological assessment of the same region, using the example of Prince William Sound, Alaska (USA). Specifically, we compare the spatial coincidence of local perceptions of biological importance (or value) identified in a survey of Alaska residents with biologically significant areas identified by scientists familiar with the area from a marine conservation workshop. The results indicate a moderate degree of spatial coincidence between local values and scientific assessment with obvious geographic areas of agreement and disagreement. We suggest that incorporation of local perceptions of biological importance can complement and strengthen scientific biological assessments and propose an iterative conservation planning process that includes both methodologies.

434	This article reviews the discourse about geographic information system's (GIS) potential as a tool for intervening in disputes over access to natural resources. GIS is a planning tool with striking analytical capabilities and a great public appeal that can be utilized for explicitly reasoned discussions to facilitate conflict resolution. However, the technology's reputation as an interventionist tool has been undermined by competing claims about human factors that sustain conflicts. Some scholars believe elements of a conflict are manageable and that meaningful communication between disputants will erase misconceptions and generate consensus. Others reject cooperation and instead emphasize self-interest and competition as the driving forces behind conflicts. This article investigates the two claims and argues that both the competitive push to claim independent rewards and the urge to create joint values are present in a conflict resolution. A more productive discussion of GIS's role in conflict management, therefore, involves unpacking the links between competitive forces that sustain a conflict and the social norms and group expectations that govern human behavior in society. The article discusses the links between value systems, opinions, and actions and how a GIS application might influence such human attributes to induce changes that promote cooperation. The study concludes with a case study involving the use of GIS to manage a conflict over natural resources allocation in a rural community in Southern Ghana.	10.1111/j.1467-8306.2004.09401003.x	2004
435	The quickly increasing number of spatio-temporal applications in fields like environmental monitoring, geology and mobile communication is a new challenge to the development of geodatabases. However, the query functionality of today's geo-information systems is still limited to the thematic attributes of spatial objects and to spatial 2-D objects. This article reports on GeoToolKit, an object-oriented geo-database kernel system developed at Bonn University to support 3-D/4-D geological applications. GeoToolKit is not a GIS-in-a-box package, but rather a library of C + + classes that allows the incorporation of spatio-temporal functionality within an application. Being a component toolkit, it encourages the development and deployment of re-usable and open software. The history, concepts and implementation of GeoToolKit are discussed in detail. Performance tests underline the practicability of the concepts. Extensions to and experiences with GeoToolKit applications like GeoStore, GeoWeb and WellStore are presented. Finally, we give an outlook on our future research introducing GeoToolKit as a 3-D/4-D database component within a network of distributed and mobile geo-information services.	10.1023/B:GEIN.0000007723.77851.8f	2004
436	This article investigates the cognitive processes used by learners (adults and young adolescents) for tasks that require the integration of geographical information across spaces, hierarchies, and geographic scales. An experiment simulated basic GIS functions and contained four experimental conditions (Chunk, Layer, Scale, and Whole). Reaction time, accuracy, and confidence were recorded as dependent variables related to the success of the integration process. The data were used as input for a back-propagation neural-network model. The neural network model was successful in learning patterns and could be used to predict the confidence, reaction time, and accuracy for combinations of learners, experimental conditions, and map-feature categories. A multivariate analysis of variance was used to determine significant relationships among the behavioral variables and characteristics of the learners, experimental conditions related to GIS functions, and map features (points, lines, and areas). The results of the analysis generally indicated that young adolescent learners were slower, less accurate, and more confident than adult learners for all experimental conditions. Overall, subjects were more accurate and confident in tasks that required less integration of geographical information. Learners had the most success recalling information related to area symbols and the least success recalling information related to point symbols.	10.1111/j.1467-8306.2003.09304004.x	2003
437	The adoption of participatory spatial planning (PSP) approaches has been partially supported by developments in participatory-GIS (P-GIS), as seen in applications both in local resource management in developing South countries, and in community neighbourhood planning in the urban North. Such applications provide a basis for examining the relationship between the use of geo-information and governance, as many P-GIS initiatives claim to foster accountability, transparency, legitimacy and other dimensions of governance. Examples from recent literature illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of utilising P-GIS, and in particular, the implications for greater participation, empowerment, and ownership of and access to spatial information, and for governance in general. Some new developments in GIS technology, like 'mobile-GIS', have the potential to strengthen these impacts. While P-GIS is not an essential component of PSP, if used with an adequate regard and sensitivity for issues of ownership, legitimacy and local knowledge, it can contribute to the empowerment of communities in solving spatial planning problems.

438	Our investigation of the geography of fall injuries considers the relationship between injury prevention and contextual approaches to health research. We use a geographic information system (GIS) to describe the pattern of emergency department reported falls of the elderly in the Capital Health Region, an administrative health area in Alberta, Canada. We used empirical Bayes estimates to obtain a geographic measure of fall incidence over the study area and a cluster detection statistic to measure the presence of a significant spatial cluster in the region. Inner-city Edmonton had the highest incidence of risk, suburban Edmonton the lowest, and surrounding rural regions and smaller communities had more moderate fall incidence. We argue that descriptive geography can enhance the effectiveness of injury prevention programs by identifying zones of high risk, even when the individual-level and contextual factors that explain the underlying patterns are unknown.

439	Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are often seen as incompatible with participatory processes. However, since the late 1990s, attempts have been made in numerous projects around the world to define \\best practices\\" for improved natural resource management projects that integrate participation and accurate spatial information, using GIS (for example, see www.iapad.org/participatory_gis.htm). This article describes a project in the Peruvian Andes where spatial information played a key role. Can GIS help narrow the gap between professionals and farmers or local officials? Or is it really a top-down tool that requires too much expert knowledge  and are investments too great for remote rural areas? Examples of successful use of GIS are provided in this article, while practical complications and methodological constraints are highlighted."	10.1659/0276-4741(2003)023[0320:GAATIP]2.0.CO;2	2003
441	Objective To determine the relationship between blood lead concentration (Pb-S), and sociodemographic parameters among children. Methods Blood lead concentration (Pb-S) was determined in 243 children (aged 5.94 +/- 2.78 years) in the district of Valencia. The required analysis was performed at the Center for Toxicological Investigations of University of Carabobo (CITUC), Venezuela, between January 1st, 1998 to December 31st, 2000. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology was used for data mapping. Results Average Pb-S (11.62 ug/dl) was significantly higher than the allowed levels. One hundred and fifty (61.7%) children had Pb-S levels above the allowed concentration (VSLP) and this amount was significantly high in relation to the total number of subjects studied. The logistic regression analysis showed a significant association of sectors 12 (status A) and 16 and 28 (status C) with VSLP (R=0.1189; p less than or equal to 0,01; R=0.1202, pless than or equal to0,01 and R=0.1189; pless than or equal to0.01, respectively). Odds ratio showed that children from status C are 7,286 times more likely to have Pb-S VSLP than those from A or B. Conclusions This study confirms that SGI and epidemiological-statistical methods widen the possibilities of preventing contaminants' adverse health effects. It also shows that correlating geographical and health data has allowed to identifying \\high risk\\" areas, leading to a pro-active public health action."	10.1590/S0034-89102003000400016	2003
442	As a result of increasingly apparent and problematic effects of global information system and remote sensing technologies, there has been increased emphasis on demonstrating and incorporating indigenous environmental knowledges in land use and cover analysis. Such approaches, though ethnographically revealing and politically efficacious, tend to reproduce a model of difference between local and scientific knowledges that is epistemologically untenable. This paper demonstrates an alternative use of geographic information system and remotely sensed imagery to both demonstrate the partiality of mapping technology and show possibilities for critical usage of the tool. Using a case from India, the research shows a method to elicit and explore competing environmental knowledges, including and especially those of \\scientific\\" experts. The analysis concludes that, for both local producers and expert managers, the cultural meaning of landscapes is dependent on their roles in regional production and resource politics."	10.1023/A:1023932829887	2003
443	Environmental analysts increasingly utilize remote sensing (RS) and geographic information science (GIS) techniques to study the relationship between human societies and their biophysical environment. This paper considers the influence these techniques have had on environmental research. Using the case of the Sahel, the paper first relates contemporary applications of RS/GIS to the history of the environmental scientific practice in the region. While facilitating an expansion of spatiotemporal scales, applications of these new techniques continue the methodological failings of the past by relying on visual measures of environmental change and problematic indicators of human land-use pressures. The human ecology fields ( human, cultural, and political ecologies), by emphasizing the causal connections between local management and environmental change, can address the problems inherent with the spatial analytical turn in environmental science. Using the author's experience with the use of GIS in a political ecology study of grazing management in western Niger, ways of more closely integrating RS/GIS techniques into human ecological research are discussed.	10.1023/A:1023984813957	2003
444	This article examines the process by which remotely sensed land cover maps work to both simplify and complicate landscapes. The central argument is not merely that the construction of land cover maps is complex, but that the points of complexity often arise through the process of trying to simplify. In other words, the forces of complexity are intimately connected to the forces of simplicity and vice versa. This article takes as a case study the production of WISCLAND, ( Wisconsin Initiative for Statewide Cooperation on Landscape Analysis and Data), a statewide land cover map of Wisconsin derived from remote sensing data and GIS ( Geographic Information Systems) technologies and proceeds by analysis of mapping methodology, practice, and representation. In addition to the development of a more nuanced critique of the use of land cover maps, it facilitates the possibility for a constructive dialogue between remote sensing practitioners and the critical GIS community.	10.1023/A:1023936930795	2003
445	Geographic information systems (GIS) technology is increasingly being used by nongovernmental organizations, grassroots organizations and other activist groups involved in transforming social, economic and environmental policy in multiple countries. The use of GIS represents a response to the fact that environmental problems are multidimensional and refuse to acknowledge political borders. It also represents a growing awareness that, for activism to compete in an era of globalization, it must utilize tools that scale from a local to a multinational level. A research field called public participation GIS (PPGIS) has emerged to investigate the use and value of GIS by marginalized peoples and communities engaged in social change. It has yet to formally examine cross-border and multinational applications. This paper makes a substantial contribution to moving the PPGIS research agenda forward to pace existing nonprofit activities. The paper considers the critical aspects of PPGIS being used across borders and in scaling up nonprofit organizations. The paper briefly reviews the PPGIS literature on issues of resources and data access and the role of GIS expertise. It then analyzes the use of PPGIS across borders as a function of building organizational capacity. Theory is reinforced with examples of nonprofits currently using GIS in multiple countries. A transnational PPGIS is framed, which can serve as a base for further investigation and discussion.	10.1111/1541-0064.02e12	2003
446	The authors examine the relevance of public participation geographic information systems (PPGISs) to housing-estate management in Singapore. Formal interviews were conducted with five key informants to collect data. A mock-up PPGIS was developed and evaluated. Informal interviews with property managers and secondary data also contributed to the discussions. Findings suggest that the current level of information technology applications and the mandate to build a 'People's Town' in Singapore's public housing estate have laid a solid base for introducing PPGIS to housing-estate management. The existing channels of public participation in town council management also pointed to a collective form, based on the Residents' Committees, for accessing and using the PPGIS. It is hoped that this study contributes to PPGIS research by extending explorations to a new cultural context and to a new application area.	10.1068/b12938	2003
447	Despite considerable progress in recent geographic information systems (GIS) research (especially on public-participation GIS), the critical discourse on GIS in the 1990s does not seem to have affected GIS practices in geographic research in significant ways. Development in critical GIS practice has been quite limited to date, and GIS and critical geographies remain two separate, if not overtly antagonistic, worlds. This suggests that critical engagement that seeks to conceive and materialize the critical potential of GIS for geographic research is still sorely needed. In this article, I explore the possibilities for this kind of critical engagement through revisiting some of the central arguments in the critical discourse from feminist perspectives. I examine whether GIS methods are inherently incompatible with feminist epistemologies through interrogating their connection with positivist scientific practices and visualization technologies. Bearing in mind the limitations of current GIS, I explore several ways in which GIS methods may be used to enrich feminist geographic research. I propose to reimagine GIS as a method in feminist geography and describe feminist visualization as a possible critical practice in feminist research. I argue that GIS can be re-envisioned and used in feminist geography in ways that are congenial to feminist epistemologies and politics. These alternative practices represent a new kind of critical engagement with GIS that is grounded on the critical agency of the GIS user/researcher.	10.1111/1467-8306.00309	2002
448	This paper deals with the representation and the processing of information about spatial objects with indeterminate location like valleys or dunes (objects subject to vagueness). The indeterminacy of the location of spatial objects is caused by the vagueness of the unity condition provided by the underlying human concepts valley and dune. We propose the notion of rough, i.e., approximate, location for representing and processing information about indeterminate location of objects subject to vagueness. We provide an analysis of the relationships between vagueness of concepts, indeterminacy of location of objects, and rough approximations using methods of formal ontology. In the second part of the paper we propose an algebraic formalization of rough location, and hence, a formal method for the representation of objects subject to vagueness on a computer. We further define operations on those representations, which can be interpreted as union and intersection operations between those objects. The discussion of vagueness of concepts, indeterminacy of location, rough location and the relationships between these notions contributes to the theory about the ontology of geographic space. The formalization presented can provide the foundation for the implementation of vague objects and their location indeterminacy in GIS.	10.1023/A:1015291525685	2002
449	Geographic information systems (GIS) technology offers a new way for different disciplines to jointly learn and manage our planet's resources. However, GIS data sources and processes preclude participation of non-technology experts who may have crucial environmental information to share. This paper is about a study in using participatory methods in what usually is an expert-dependent use of GIS. It hinges on the technology's integrative spatial analysis capability and people's intimate knowledge of their own space. The case study details how isolated rural farmers of Ifugao, Northern Philippines engaged in collectively interpreting aerial-photographs and satellite images, and tracing their successful tradition in terraced agriculture. In the process, a different side of GIS is shown-from mapping and data management to that of jointly constructing and understanding the 'world' to be managed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

450	Studies about geographical information systems (GIS) use contribute to geographic information science through critical evaluation of the concepts embedded in GIS tools. Social-behavioural studies about group use of GIS help us to understand the social implications of GIS because groups are fundamental units underlying intra-organizational, organization-wide, and inter-organizational activity in society. When group communication technology is integrated with basic GIS capabilities an enhanced version of GIS called 'participatory GIS' (PGIS) is created. Group use of PGIS technology can be studied by sampling social-behavioural events during human-computer-human interaction. Social-behavioural research about PGIS use requires an informed balance among three research domains-substantive, theoretical, and methodological-if we are to make balanced progress in participatory geographical information science associated with the critical evaluation of GIS use. In this paper, we draw from our research on GIS-supported collaborative decision making about land use and resource planning and a conceptual framework called Enhanced Adaptive Structuration Theory. We develop a new framework for understanding choices among data-gathering strategies for social-behavioural studies about PGIS use. The framework for data-gathering strategies is composed of two dimensions. One dimension is the level of induced control in social-behavioural relations during GIS use in a research setting. The other is the amount of pre- or post-structuring of variables embedded in data-collection techniques. Several common data-gathering strategies, e. g. laboratory experiment, field experiment, case study, and field survey, are differentiated in terms of those dimensions. Objectives for empirical research are used to compare and contrast the data-gathering strategies. This framework helps researchers understand the trade-offs among various data-gathering strategies as the core of research designs for critical evaluations of PGIS use.	10.1080/13658810110075987	2002
451	In this paper we describe an attempt to create an inclusive and participatory information sharing network across a large geographic region, the Gulf of Maine. This network aims to contribute to the health of the region's human and natural environments through facilitating partnerships among individuals and organizations that are already working toward this goal. Initiated at a time when cooperation, public learning, and information sharing increasingly depend on digital information technologies, this effort represents a turn away from earlier attempts to create centralized data sharing systems toward a more people-centered and project-centered approach. After introducing the Gulf of Maine Environmental Information Exchange and its region, particular projects will be described, along with the on-line technologies that are being applied including those related to digital mapping. A description of the purposes of the Information Exchange follows, with details about a network organization which is being shaped based on principles that have emerged through participant interactions. Public participation GIS and the community-based fisheries management movement are presented as examples of participatory governance that have contributed to discussions within the Information Exchange. We conclude with a summary of the accomplishments of this network building process and the challenges its participants recognize at this time.	10.1068/b2749t	2001
452	In this paper we describe the development of Internet-based approaches to public participation and on-line spatial decision support systems in particular. Two case studies in developing web-based public participation GIS (PPGIS), one local and one regional, are described in detail. Results from the live testing of these systems are shown. These are discussed in the light of recent developments in 'cyberdemocracy' and conclusions are drawn about principles of on-line PPGIS and problems associated with public participation, user interaction, and familiarity with IT, copyright issues, access to the Internet, and relevant political structures.	10.1068/b2751t	2001
453	Development planning in South Africa is moving towards a people-centred, democratic approach with a strong emphasis on community involvement, which had previously been lacking. This paradigmatic shift to an integrated and considerate approach lends itself to the inclusion of spatially orientated geographical information systems (GIS) technology. The paper outlines a number of South African planning processes and shows how GIS could be incorporated to the betterment of these processes. Cognisance is taken of a number of concerns surrounding the utilisation of what is traditionally perceived to be a top-down, authoritative, technocratic technology. A number of solutions are proposed, including the development of a participatory GIS and the co-construction of decision-making processes through community communication. A key issue to consider is the need for the planning process to develop a 'conscience' and become 'considerate', in order to facilitate the development and implementation of a successful process and to communicate these findings to previously disempowered communities.

454	Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are increasingly applied as modern tools for analysis and visualization of health-related spatial data, especially in epidemiological research. GIS are used by medical researchers and executives in the public health service. A community-based survey was conducted according to the phase II protocol of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) in Munich. The spatial patterns of disease incidence were analysed and related to exposure data by GIS. The prevalence study on fourth-grade pupils (n=3354) and school beginners (n = 2890) was conducted during the school term 1995/96 in Munich. Parental questionnaires and measurements of lung function and immunological parameters were used. The questionnaire data were integrated in a GIS database. In this paper we discuss methodological aspects of GIS-based spatial analysis related to epidemiological data. In addition, we investigate whether there were spatial clusters of children with wheeze in the last 12 months of a magnitude unlikely to occur by chance and which could indicate local health risks. The study was based on permutation tests where global and local methods were applied. No spatial clusters of children with asthma symptoms were identified in the city of Munich.	10.1055/s-2000-12608	2000
455	The African continent is portrayed in development texts as experiencing environmental crises of staggering proportions. Despite a lack of reliable data, the World Bank considers environmental degradation to be so widespread that the \\business\\" of environmental planning and regulation is now seen as a global affair. It currently requires low-income countries receiving its financial assistance to develop National Environmental Action Plans (NEAPs) which, in assembly line fashion, are bring produced according to a blueprint. Taking the West African case study of Cote d'Ivoire, this paper argues that the planning process, specifically the identification of environmental problems, is based on a poor understanding of the nature and direction of environmental change. We confront this data problem by contrasting the image of a deforested savanna landscape found in the Cote d'Ivoire NEAP with the more wooded landscape experienced by farmers and herders and confirmed by our analysis of aerial photographs. Our second objective is to address thr policy implications of two geographical issues rising from this paper: the disjointed scale problem between local/regional environmental-change patterns and global environmental discourses, and the human-environmental consequences of ignoring actual versus imagined environmental problems. A third goal is to contribute to the growing convergence in cultural and political ecology around the use of multiple research methods to explain environmental-change dynamics. Our discussion of environmental change is informed by intensive data collection in two rural communities in the Korhogo region of northern Cote d'Ivoire. Research methods included focus-group discussions and household surveys to record local perceptions of environmental change. Aerial photo analysis, GIS mapping, and vegetation transects were used to interpret land-cover changes. Finally, interviews with individuals involved in the NEAP process in the Cote d'Ivoire government, World Bank, and NGOs illuminated the received ideas and institutional interests of various players in environmental planning."	10.1111/0004-5608.00184	2000
456	As in other areas of planning practice, the use of GIS in neighborhood planning has assumed a technical: top-down approach. Given the fact that GIS are essentially about providing and analyzing spatial data, it is difficult to envision how their use in local communities could be construed otherwise. In this paper I make a case for the need to channel intellectual energy,into developing an approach and methodology for resident-generated GIS. Specifically I argue-that there is:a need to exploit GIS in the investigation of residents' perceptions of local neighborhood environments. I explore this approach in five sections. First, I present a definition of resident-generated GIS and position it within the larger debate on public participation GIS. Second, I offer a review of the current use of GIS in local neighborhood communities. This consists of an empirical assessment of neighborhood GIS as well as a critique of community GIS from the perspective of scholars in planning and geography. Third, I review the theoretical background that is integral to-and must form the basis of-a resident-generated GIS. Three theoretical traditions are relevant: environmental perception; indigenous information and its use in GIS; and neighborhood-level issues that could be enlightened through the use of GIS. Fourth, I propose a methodological framework for constructing and utilizing resident-generated GIS. Fifth, I discuss the political implications of a resident-generated GIS.	10.1068/b260533	1999
457	This article presents the description logic ALCRP(D) with concrete domains and a role-forming predicate operator as its prominent aspects. We demonstrate the feasibility of ALCRP(D) for reasoning about spatial objects and their qualitative spatial relationships and provide an appropriate concrete domain for spatial objects. The general significance of ALCRP(D) is demonstrated by adding temporal reasoning to spatial and terminological reasoning using a combined concrete domain. The theory is motivated as a basis for knowledge representation and query processing in the domain of geographic information systems. In contrast to existing work in this domain, which mainly focuses either on conceptual reasoning or on reasoning about qualitative spatial relations, we integrate reasoning about spatial information with terminological reasoning.	10.1093/logcom/9.3.351	1999
458	Logics for qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR) are presented and investigated. Some basic desiderata are suggested for such theories of QSR, relating to the underexplored issue of their formal semantics. We survey our earlier results in the field of QSR which show that existing theories fail to meet these desiderata. Finally, a complete calculus is presented, describing mereotopological relations between polygonal regions of the plane. The polygonal ontology supported by this logic is 'practical' in the sense that it is that employed by many computer systems for spatial representation, for example, in geographical information systems (GIS). We show that the proposed theory meets the desiderata outlined at the beginning of the paper. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.	10.1006/jvlc.1997.0068	1998
459	A framework for the qualitative representation of positional information in a two-dimensional space is presented. Qualitative representations use discrete quantity spaces, where a particular distinction is introduced only if it is relevant to the context being modeled. This allows us to build a flexible framework that accommodates various levels of granularity and scales of reasoning. Knowledge about position in large-scale space is commonly represented by a combination of orientation and distance relations, which we express in a particular frame of reference between a primary object and a reference object. While the representation of orientation comes out to be more straightforward, the model for distances requires that qualitative distance symbols be mapped to geometric intervals in order to be compared; this is done by defining structure relations that are able to handle, among others, order of magnitude relations; the frame of reference with its three components (distance system, scale, and type) captures the inherent context dependency of qualitative distances, The principal aim of the qualitative representation is to perform spatial reasoning: as a basic inference technique, algorithms for the composition of positional relations are developed with respect to same and different frames of reference. The model presented in this paper has potential applications in areas as diverse as Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Computer Aided Design (CAD), and Document Recognition.

460	This paper examines recent debate concerning the concepts of 'sustainable knowledge' and 'hybridity' in environmental research. Hybrid studies employ local, indigenous knowledge alongside global, scientific techniques to achieve guidelines for sustainable development. The paper discusses the value of indigenous knowledge in testing theories of environmental degradation, and the problems of overcoming socio-political constructions of environmental problems over wide time and space scales, as identified by Regional Political Ecology. The paper focuses on the so-called theory of Himalayan environmental degradation and illustrates the study with a case from northern Thailand. In Thailand, upland shifting cultivators are blamed for causing lowland sedimentation and water shortages, and have been considered by lowland communities to lack awareness of environmental degradation. The study used indigenous knowledge alongside GIS analysis and the Caesium-137 technique for measuring soil erosion to test the assumptions that land shortage has increased cultivation on steeper slopes, and that erosion is a problem for upland degradation. This is the first time these new techniques have been used in testing assumptions related to Himalayan degradation. Results indicated that upland farmers deliberately avoid erosion by increasing frequency of cultivation of flatter slopes rather than steeper slopes, and consequently the problem of erosion is overstated. However, this does not imply that their local knowledge is useful over larger areas, but instead shows the adaptability of local communities and their awareness of environmental risk. It is therefore argued that developing effective management techniques depends on differentiating more clearly between locally-based knowledge about environmental processes; politically-constructed statements about the environmental impacts of other groups; and falsifiable scientific assertions aiming to develop effective management techniques with reference to several communities.

461	Qualitative spatial reasoning is normally concerned with various methods for reasoning in images that in many cases are symbolic, like for instance, maps. The goal is to identify complex object relations by means of methods operating on a high abstraction level. Several approaches to spatial reasoning have been proposed and one such method is symbolic projection which is a qualitative reasoning technique. The method that will be discussed here is an extension of symbolic projection that specifically is concerned with the observer's point of view. In other words, the work presented here is concerned with qualitative spatial reasoning for determination of, among other things, directions, distances and other object relations seen from the observer's perspective, i.e. the projections are in the majority of cases concerned with a singular point. Furthermore, it will also be demonstrated that the slope projections introduced in this paper are a generalization of the original approach of symbolic projection.	10.1016/0031-3203(94)90165-1	1994
462	Highlights•Community based restoration of mangroves promote mangrove management.•We used a mangrove planting Association in Ghana as a case study.•Participatory mapping was used to assess extent of mangrove cover change.•Mangrove cover increased between 1974 and 1992, but decreased from 1992 to 2010.•Economic reasons were the major motivation for mangrove replanting.\r\r\n\r\r\nEven though global interest in mangrove research has increased in recent years, unveiling their immense ecological and economic roles, very little work has been done to investigate the primary driving factors motivating long-term community-based mangrove restoration and management on local scales. In Ghana, policy makers and coastal management practitioners have recently embraced the concept of community-based and co-management of coastal and marine resources. Community-based and co-management approaches require that key stakeholders, most notably the resource users themselves, play significant roles and responsibilities in the management process. However, there is little evaluation of the process in Ghana to assess the success or otherwise, particularly of the few and long standing examples of community-based approaches in coastal resource management. With special reference to an over two decade old community-based mangrove forestry programme along the Volta estuary of Ghana, this paper provides concepts for examination of the ecological and socioeconomic factors influencing mangrove restoration and management by fishers, fish mongers, farmers and their socioeconomic groupings. Participatory GIS mapping and the use of orthophotos generated for the period 1974–2011 provided additional information on temporal evolution of the extent of mangrove areas restored and managed by local stakeholders. Socioeconomic assessment of mangrove products utility was done through questionnaire interviews. The results indicate that livelihoods and economic benefits are the primary factors that motivate local stakeholders' participation in mangrove restoration and management. Mangroves provisioning services, markets and low livelihoods diversification are major drivers of mangrove resources exploitation. The study has shown that mangroves resources can be sustainably exploited, restored and managed if local customary rules are enforced and institutional arrangements put in place to mediate mangrove exploitation and regeneration rates. Such an approach if well developed, could promote coastal resources conservation with high economic returns for the users.	10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2016.04.006	2016
